    # Rejected for now, and why
    # "-W" "clippy::default_trait_access" - sometimes makes imports necessary, just for a default value. It's good for more explicit typing though.
    # "-W" "clippy::range_plus_one" - useful, but caused too many false positives as we use range types directly quite a lot
    # "-W", "clippy::explicit_iter_loop", - the cases I saw turned `foo.iter_mut()` into `&mut *foo`


    # Rustdoc lints
    # "-W", "rustdoc::warning_name"
    # "-A", "rustdoc::warning_name"
