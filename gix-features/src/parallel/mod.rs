//! Run computations in parallel, or not based the `parallel` feature toggle.
//!
//! ### in_parallel(…)
//!
//! The [`in_parallel(…)`][in_parallel()] is the typical fan-out-fan-in mode of parallelism, with thread local storage
//! made available to a `consume(…)` function to process input. The result is sent to the [`Reduce`] running in the calling
//! thread to aggregate the results into a single output, which is returned by [`in_parallel()`].
//!
//! Interruptions can be achieved by letting the reducers [`feed(…)`][Reduce::feed()]` method fail.
//!
//! It gets a boost in usability as it allows threads to borrow variables from the stack, most commonly the repository itself
//! or the data to work on.
//!
//! This mode of operation doesn't lend itself perfectly to being wrapped for `async` as it appears like a single long-running
//! operation which runs as fast as possible, which is cancellable only by merit of stopping the input or stopping the output
//! aggregation.
//!
//! ### `reduce::Stepwise`
//!
//! The [`Stepwise`][reduce::Stepwise] iterator works exactly as [`in_parallel()`] except that the processing of the output produced by
//! `consume(I, &mut State) -> O` is made accessible by the `Iterator` trait's `next()` method. As produced work is not
//! buffered, the owner of the iterator controls the progress made.
//!
//! Getting the final output of the [`Reduce`] is achieved through the consuming [`Stepwise::finalize()`][reduce::Stepwise::finalize()] method, which
//! is functionally equivalent to calling [`in_parallel()`].
//!
//! In an `async` context this means that progress is only made each time `next()` is called on the iterator, while merely dropping
//! the iterator will wind down the computation without any result.
//!
//! #### Maintaining Safety
//!
//! In order to assure that threads don't outlive the data they borrow because their handles are leaked, we enforce
//! the `'static` lifetime for its inputs, making it less intuitive to use. It is, however, possible to produce
//! suitable input iterators as long as they can hold something on the heap.
