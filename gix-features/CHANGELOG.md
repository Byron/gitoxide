and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.36.0 (2023-10-12)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4c03fdbc831349ea7f45b68331f554ade859abf5/> add `hash::bytes_with_header()`, also make it 32bit compatible.
   That way it's possible to hash entire files as object.
   Previously it wasn't possible to read more than u32::MAX bytes even
   on 32 bit system even though we are streaming the data.

## 0.35.0 (2023-09-24)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-51971969d2cf13587d4bfbd4cb047f2377b8bc0f/> Add `threading::make_mut()` to allow obtaining a mutable reference to shared data.
   This is particularly useful when handling an index file, which may be shared across clones of
   a repository.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-7a8f79357ce99c4b86e22be166b54f7376c71469/> cargo-auditable build error
   Use `prodash` instead of `dep:prodash` in gix-features and `tracing`
   instead of `dep:tracing` in gitoxide-core.
   
   The `dep:mydep` syntax removes the implicit `mydep` feature for optional
   dependencies, this triggers a bug in cargo that affects
   `cargo-auditable`. See https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12336
   
   This affects some Linux distributions like NixOS which use
   `cargo-auditable` by default. Related issues:
   
   - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/253911

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-70c7c29266bc4396c968c7aa311c9721929a7cab/> parallel utilities that create thread-state now use `FnOnce`.
   This way, all unnecessary cloning is avoided.

## 0.34.0 (2023-09-08)

<csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/>

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/> update to the latest `prodash`
   It makes proper usage of `Progress` types easier and allows them to be used
   as `dyn` traits as well.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-24dd870919ba444aa8099c63a78ea120d47ec28e/> use `prodash::Count` to indicate that nothing more than counting is performed, in place of `prodash::Progress`

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.32.0 (2023-07-19)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-2a76929ece48c3b0fbdba7e08ae5d7e647db4d36/> add `in_parallel_with_finalize` to support a usecase for `gix-worktree`
 - <csr-id-717950977fa758812bc4dd5713f96995bddc491a/> add `interrupt::Write` to auto-fail writes on interrupt.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-032cea3d6cfde80fdfc7bfe8722e2514d2bcb5cf/> remove `zlib::stream::inflate::ReadBoxed`.
   It was a special-case type that was only used in one spot, and thus
   not really that interesting to have in a shared place.

<csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/> Add `clippy::redundant-closure-for-method-calls` lint

### New Features

 - <csr-id-093efafa7c39aa03bfef4894779cca6e3716f471/> add `tracing` feature toggle to provide minimal tracing API
   This API is based on `tracing-core`, not on tracing, and provides a limited
   API that is always available, while being a no-op if `tracing` isn't enabled.
   
   That way, plumbing crates can add instrumentation at will.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bc69804d5f6cba56349b5b15a2f6d1741849a5eb/> `new_thread_state()` functions are now `FnOnce` across the board.
   This properly communicates that they will only be called once per thread,
   while providing more options to the implementor.

## 0.30.0 (2023-06-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d81b7e3036371d0a2a22f02a92df3c2b2950ff22/> add `zlib::Inflate::reset()`.
   That way, each instance can be reused.
 - <csr-id-add5ea8b83d00972b560536da82f9914ef6080d3/> make `prodash::RawProgress` available.
   It's an object-safe version of the `Progress` trait.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0fa04bcbdf3102c5435e64cfef894a1bfc8d6e7b/> make current thread-count accessible in slice-workers.
   Threads started for working on an entry in a slice can now see the amount
   of threads left for use (and manipulate that variable) which effectively
   allows them to implement their own parallelization on top of the current one.
   
   This is useful if there is there is very imbalanced work within the slice itself.
   
   While at it, we also make consumer functions mutable as they exsit per thread.

## 0.28.0 (2023-03-04)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-571ec0d7c3e1eb167d55daa6551bd2b27d3c5b25/> use `std::thread::scope()` instead of `crossbeam-utils::thread::scope()`.

## 0.27.0 (2023-03-01)

<csr-id-cce96ee1382d3d56d77820a2aba6e2d17b52f91c/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-cce96ee1382d3d56d77820a2aba6e2d17b52f91c/> replace `quick-error` with `thiserror`
   This increases the compile time of the crate alone if there is no proc-macro
   in the dependency tree, but will ever so slightly improve compile times for `gix`
   as a whole.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7a442313c57f58fec5217484f268516711c3d52b/> make `bytesize` available in `progress`.
   Note that it is stubbed out unless the `progress-unit-bytes` feature is set.
 - <csr-id-7f6a807ea506358b6dc4fd0c7a648770f1dc91e9/> add `progress::count_with_decimals()` and `progress-unit-*` feature toggles.
   The new feature toggles allow controlling the inclusion of the `bytesize` and `human_format`
   crates, which can be toggled with the `progress-unit-bytes` and `progress-unit-human-numbers` respectively.
   
   Without these features, the respective functions exist but don't provide special formatting, making bytes and
   larger numbers harder to read.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-264f78a508d3030cb346623f57ac75add7682169/> remove `num_cpus` in favor of `std::thread::available_parallelism()`.
   `num_cpus` was needed back in the days when `std` didn't support such
   functionality yet.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0cc548041a861be21001462cbe0ef29b1d61d1c4/> use new `dep:` syntax to hide optional features from feature-set.
   That way, the set of features is clearly defined and controlled.
   This migth break applications who relied on direect access to features named
   after optional dependencies.

## 0.26.5 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

## 0.26.4 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-5bf0034fb3918e57562b7089ceba83d63a1854bf/>
<csr-id-ab6f98b905f13ed2a7c0c483f34fab63141fbc5b/>

<csr-id-361892ca15aa648802f6701ab6a5a30aedde3449/>

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0f27c67c92fc0bc23a6712b5c4c730ad6a0156bf/> add support for explicit non-parallel iteration.
   That way we can allow the implementation to choose whether they
   need greatest speed at some cost or not.
   
   This also allows us to create a new thread-pool on each iteration
   as those who expect high cost or many files will likely chose to do
   that instead of single-threaded iteration, which nicely contains the
   threads needed and avoids keeping them alive as part of some global pool.
 - <csr-id-3b29fc18672c0176684c797a0f16f85d09369bf8/> make jwalk fully optional
 - <csr-id-d078d6ee76a80d1dfaf71608c12d8a402bd670d4/> mild refactor of paths module to waste less on unix
   Previously it might have performed find-and-replace on unix paths even
   though they wouldn't have changed afterwards, yet costing an allocation.
   
   There is also the realization that it should go into its own crate to have
   neater import paths and more convenience.
 - <csr-id-8945d95f7fa88562d37ff67ac6e38bead73dd2df/> `interrupt::Iter`, rename `interrupt::Iter` -> `interrupt::IterWithError`

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5bf0034fb3918e57562b7089ceba83d63a1854bf/> upgrade to prodash v23

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-38446dc8824afef30ef121598de3451d13b9262c/> remove `fs-jwalk-single-threaded` in favor of `fs-walkdir-parallel`.
   This way, `jwalk` and the dependencies (and troubles) it brings have to
   be opted in, but also allow other users to actually opt out while
   allowing the `parallel` feature to be in effect.
   
   In other words, previously the `parallel` feature conflated `jwalk`
   dependencies into the tree, which isn't the case anymore.
 - <csr-id-89a41bf2b37db29b9983b4e5492cfd67ed490b23/> remove local-time-support feature toggle.
   We treat local time as default feature without a lot of fuzz, and
   will eventually document that definitive support needs a compile
   time switch in the compiler (`--cfg unsound_local_offset` or something).
   
   One day it will perish. Failure is possible anyway and we will write
   code to deal with it while minimizing the amount of system time
   fetches when asking for the current local time.
 - <csr-id-90611ce1527618bcc738440bfc1ccc7a45319974/> remove `path` module in favor of `git-path` crate
 - <csr-id-61e5cfece4d8f405e35fc1957b00ce1da7526c26/> renamed `progress::Read::reader` -> `progress::Read::inner`
 - <csr-id-e7526b2a7b51cbac4018e1ab3b623a85987fadc2/> parallel utilities now use `Send + Clone` insted of `Send + Sync`
   This helps to assure that thread-local computations always work with the
   kind of types we provide. The ones that are carrying out actions are
   notably not `Sync` anymore.
   
   We cater to that by defining our bounds accordingly, but for those
   who want to use other utilities that need Sync, using types like
   `Repository` and `thread_local!()` is the only way to make this
   work.

### Other

 - <csr-id-ab6f98b905f13ed2a7c0c483f34fab63141fbc5b/> try-join with static typing works, but…
   …seems like a lot of effort. Probably not worth continuing here

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-234cd10ca55482ce1a840ce3244308d249895bcc/> Assure std::io::copy() doesn't hang when we cause an interrupt
   The user can ask for interruptions which previously used the
   error kind Interrupted. This however has special meaning and
   usually means to retry.

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-361892ca15aa648802f6701ab6a5a30aedde3449/> update sha-1 dependency to 0.10

### New Features

 - <csr-id-a3bd14a7753716e7ad67cd56d24eee1fa099a6fd/> re-export `prodash::progress::(Task|Value)` directly under `progress`
   This is in addition to the `progress` re-export which allows everything
   but yields less optimal import paths.
 - <csr-id-426057247a80821b3da22b4ae5d67bda89ce0631/> re-export `prodash` in `progress` module.
   That way one can access all types even if they are not re-exported.
 - <csr-id-c4a7634b0b29c74625e183953e59c65987e9d66c/> export `prodash::progress::Id` in the `progress` module for convenience.
 - <csr-id-25ad372bf500b851105f53b10369b5a689ba167e/> zlib::inflate::Error can now represent zlib status codes that represent failure.
 - <csr-id-6d530a1dc77f0f4ac00622a2fd47c7bdb731a77a/> name spawned threads
   That way it's a bit more obvious what's happening when the CPU goes
   up in flames.
 - <csr-id-c8835c6edae784c9ffcb69a674c0a6545dbb2af3/> upgrade to `prodash 21.1` and add `Ids` to all progress instances.
   That way callers can identify progress they are interested in, say, for
   selective visualizations.
 - <csr-id-9076ce33ec167e425a0163d3e40a81a3fd0db6cd/> `fs::Snapshot` can `Clone` if `T` can `Clone`.
 - <csr-id-a7c11d2cb5f88a4ff322d9a9848459062790d8b3/> perfect granularity for threads processing with `in_parallel_with_slice()`
 - <csr-id-ff1db66f2dad3afc8bc77610006bca9fea5947d2/> add `progress::Step|StepShared` as types of `prodash`
   This may help to use the `Progress::counter()` method as part of method
   signatures, being an `Option<progress::StepShared>`.
 - <csr-id-cfe46b502afc3ecb312849ddbd7748007d432cd1/> add zlib-ng feature to allow linking against system libz-ng
   Allow to use zlib-ng (zlib-ng-sys) with native API (no compat mode)
   that can co-exist with system libz (loaded by e.g. libcurl).
   This is used in gitoxide package on Alpine Linux.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-f498d35baba52e40ecd47381e87c1ce49cf13285/> add `fs-jwalk-single-threaded` feature to specifically decouple `jwalk` from rayon
   It has been an issue in https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/4251
   apparently and rayon interactions can be difficult.
 - <csr-id-7f199f0e5246809efde9880110093fbd11a4f8fe/> `fs::Snapshot` to on-demand reload shared resources.
 - <csr-id-c76fde7de278b49ded13b655d5345e4eb8c1b134/> initialize `Time` from `now_utc` and `now_local`
   Localtime support depends on some other factors now, but that
   will only get better over time.
   
   We might have to document `unsound_local_time` at some point.
 - <csr-id-e4d6685064ad2b433f8acd3a74b320bf0169a994/> Add `git_config::values::Path` for a typesafe git path
   Add a `Path` type to the `git_config::values` which
   can be interpolated according to gits own path interpolation
   rules.
 - <csr-id-3c8581fc294c65c9eb42698969fe3263135a864e/> add new 'path' module for all path-related conversions
   It's meant to unify all path and byte related handling to help assuring
   encoding is handled correctly or at least similarly everywhere.
 - <csr-id-15ff212b17087de93f259e366f4e4b821cfbc28e/> in-manifest and in-lib documentation of feature toggles
 - <csr-id-cb7e4e784d615f9fa3d6fb9c36240f0592403358/> Add InOrderIter to 'parallel' module
   This iterator makes possible identifies results using a sequence id
   and returns only consecutive items.
   
   Use it to collect unordered results produced by threads.
   It's advantage to collecting yourself and sorting is the potential
   for a smaller memory footprint of in-flight results, one doesn't
   have to collect them all for ordering, necessarily.
 - <csr-id-ca095ed881db2a8f06a6b067dbaac17e923b0945/> Make a scope-like abstraction available
   This allows more delicate threading control like is required for the
   index.
 - <csr-id-b8400ed80543d67a5895c975ba9b1fc28427411c/> decoding of variable int numbers.
   It's here only so that we can share the code across crates, for now
   without any feature toggles.
 - <csr-id-0a749a22057b5513a8cefa0e26b0a9a268c769d3/> Add `progress::Write` to automatically pass bytes written to a progress instance
 - <csr-id-7e95d8ab29051ffc892f2dcbaf5369e8c7e7b294/> add threading primitives with feature toggle
   If the `threading` feature is set, the `threading` module will contain thread-safe primitives
   for shared ownership and mutation, otherwise these will be their single threaded counterparts.
   
   This way, single-threaded applications don't have to pay for threaded primitives.

</details>

## 0.26.3 (2023-02-14)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-426057247a80821b3da22b4ae5d67bda89ce0631/> re-export `prodash` in `progress` module.
   That way one can access all types even if they are not re-exported.

## 0.26.2 (2023-02-09)

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c4a7634b0b29c74625e183953e59c65987e9d66c/> export `prodash::progress::Id` in the `progress` module for convenience.

## 0.26.1 (2023-01-10)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.26.0 (2022-12-30)

<csr-id-5bf0034fb3918e57562b7089ceba83d63a1854bf/>

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5bf0034fb3918e57562b7089ceba83d63a1854bf/> upgrade to prodash v23

## 0.25.1 (2022-12-26)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-25ad372bf500b851105f53b10369b5a689ba167e/> zlib::inflate::Error can now represent zlib status codes that represent failure.

## 0.25.0 (2022-12-19)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0f27c67c92fc0bc23a6712b5c4c730ad6a0156bf/> add support for explicit non-parallel iteration.
   That way we can allow the implementation to choose whether they
   need greatest speed at some cost or not.
   
   This also allows us to create a new thread-pool on each iteration
   as those who expect high cost or many files will likely chose to do
   that instead of single-threaded iteration, which nicely contains the
   threads needed and avoids keeping them alive as part of some global pool.

## 0.24.1 (2022-11-27)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6d530a1dc77f0f4ac00622a2fd47c7bdb731a77a/> name spawned threads
   That way it's a bit more obvious what's happening when the CPU goes
   up in flames.
 - <csr-id-c8835c6edae784c9ffcb69a674c0a6545dbb2af3/> upgrade to `prodash 21.1` and add `Ids` to all progress instances.
   That way callers can identify progress they are interested in, say, for
   selective visualizations.

## 0.24.0 (2022-11-21)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

## 0.23.1 (2022-11-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-9076ce33ec167e425a0163d3e40a81a3fd0db6cd/> `fs::Snapshot` can `Clone` if `T` can `Clone`.

## 0.23.0 (2022-10-10)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-a7c11d2cb5f88a4ff322d9a9848459062790d8b3/> perfect granularity for threads processing with `in_parallel_with_slice()`
 - <csr-id-ff1db66f2dad3afc8bc77610006bca9fea5947d2/> add `progress::Step|StepShared` as types of `prodash`
   This may help to use the `Progress::counter()` method as part of method
   signatures, being an `Option<progress::StepShared>`.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-38446dc8824afef30ef121598de3451d13b9262c/> remove `fs-jwalk-single-threaded` in favor of `fs-walkdir-parallel`.
   This way, `jwalk` and the dependencies (and troubles) it brings have to
   be opted in, but also allow other users to actually opt out while
   allowing the `parallel` feature to be in effect.
   
   In other words, previously the `parallel` feature conflated `jwalk`
   dependencies into the tree, which isn't the case anymore.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3b29fc18672c0176684c797a0f16f85d09369bf8/> make jwalk fully optional

## 0.22.6 (2022-09-16)

Fix docs.rs rendering.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-cfe46b502afc3ecb312849ddbd7748007d432cd1/> add zlib-ng feature to allow linking against system libz-ng
   Allow to use zlib-ng (zlib-ng-sys) with native API (no compat mode)
   that can co-exist with system libz (loaded by e.g. libcurl).
   This is used in gitoxide package on Alpine Linux.

## 0.22.5 (2022-09-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-cfe46b502afc3ecb312849ddbd7748007d432cd1/> add zlib-ng feature to allow linking against system libz-ng
   Allow to use zlib-ng (zlib-ng-sys) with native API (no compat mode)
   that can co-exist with system libz (loaded by e.g. libcurl).
   This is used in gitoxide package on Alpine Linux.

## 0.22.4 (2022-09-04)

A maintenance release without breaking changes.

## 0.22.3 (2022-08-27)

### Fix

- restrict `sha1` `asm` to supported archs ([`b383fab`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/b383fabbe10868317be51b99cfdd9b0981816042))

## 0.22.2 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

## 0.22.1 (2022-08-15)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f498d35baba52e40ecd47381e87c1ce49cf13285/> add `fs-jwalk-single-threaded` feature to specifically decouple `jwalk` from rayon
   It has been an issue in https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/4251
   apparently and rayon interactions can be difficult.
 - <csr-id-7f199f0e5246809efde9880110093fbd11a4f8fe/> `fs::Snapshot` to on-demand reload shared resources.

## 0.22.0 (2022-07-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c76fde7de278b49ded13b655d5345e4eb8c1b134/> initialize `Time` from `now_utc` and `now_local`
   Localtime support depends on some other factors now, but that
   will only get better over time.
   
   We might have to document `unsound_local_time` at some point.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-89a41bf2b37db29b9983b4e5492cfd67ed490b23/> remove local-time-support feature toggle.
   We treat local time as default feature without a lot of fuzz, and
   will eventually document that definitive support needs a compile
   time switch in the compiler (`--cfg unsound_local_offset` or something).
   
   One day it will perish. Failure is possible anyway and we will write
   code to deal with it while minimizing the amount of system time
   fetches when asking for the current local time.

## 0.21.1 (2022-06-13)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.21.0 (2022-05-18)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-90611ce1527618bcc738440bfc1ccc7a45319974/> remove `path` module in favor of `gix-path` crate

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d078d6ee76a80d1dfaf71608c12d8a402bd670d4/> mild refactor of paths module to waste less on unix
   Previously it might have performed find-and-replace on unix paths even
   though they wouldn't have changed afterwards, yet costing an allocation.
   
   There is also the realization that it should go into its own crate to have
   neater import paths and more convenience.

## 0.20.0 (2022-04-02)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e4d6685064ad2b433f8acd3a74b320bf0169a994/> Add `gix_config::values::Path` for a typesafe git path
   Add a `Path` type to the `gix_config::values` which
   can be interpolated according to gits own path interpolation
   rules.
 - <csr-id-3c8581fc294c65c9eb42698969fe3263135a864e/> add new 'path' module for all path-related conversions
   It's meant to unify all path and byte related handling to help assuring
   encoding is handled correctly or at least similarly everywhere.
 - <csr-id-15ff212b17087de93f259e366f4e4b821cfbc28e/> in-manifest and in-lib documentation of feature toggles

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-234cd10ca55482ce1a840ce3244308d249895bcc/> Assure std::io::copy() doesn't hang when we cause an interrupt
   The user can ask for interruptions which previously used the
   error kind Interrupted. This however has special meaning and
   usually means to retry.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-8945d95f7fa88562d37ff67ac6e38bead73dd2df/> `interrupt::Iter`, rename `interrupt::Iter` -> `interrupt::IterWithError`

## 0.19.1 (2022-01-23)

<csr-id-361892ca15aa648802f6701ab6a5a30aedde3449/>

A maintenance release thanks to upgrade to `prodash` 18.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-61e5cfece4d8f405e35fc1957b00ce1da7526c26/> renamed `progress::Read::reader` -> `progress::Read::inner`

### New Features

 - <csr-id-cb7e4e784d615f9fa3d6fb9c36240f0592403358/> Add InOrderIter to 'parallel' module
   This iterator makes possible identifies results using a sequence id
   and returns only consecutive items.
   
   Use it to collect unordered results produced by threads.
   It's advantage to collecting yourself and sorting is the potential
   for a smaller memory footprint of in-flight results, one doesn't
   have to collect them all for ordering, necessarily.
 - <csr-id-ca095ed881db2a8f06a6b067dbaac17e923b0945/> Make a scope-like abstraction available
   This allows more delicate threading control like is required for the
   index.
 - <csr-id-b8400ed80543d67a5895c975ba9b1fc28427411c/> decoding of variable int numbers.
   It's here only so that we can share the code across crates, for now
   without any feature toggles.
 - <csr-id-0a749a22057b5513a8cefa0e26b0a9a268c769d3/> Add `progress::Write` to automatically pass bytes written to a progress instance

### Chore

 - <csr-id-361892ca15aa648802f6701ab6a5a30aedde3449/> update sha-1 dependency to 0.10

## 0.19.0 (2022-01-19)

### Chore

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-61e5cfece4d8f405e35fc1957b00ce1da7526c26/> renamed `progress::Read::reader` -> `progress::Read::inner`

## 0.18.0 (2021-11-29)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7e95d8ab29051ffc892f2dcbaf5369e8c7e7b294/> add threading primitives with feature toggle
   If the `threading` feature is set, the `threading` module will contain thread-safe primitives
   for shared ownership and mutation, otherwise these will be their single threaded counterparts.
   
   This way, single-threaded applications don't have to pay for threaded primitives.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e7526b2a7b51cbac4018e1ab3b623a85987fadc2/> parallel utilities now use `Send + Clone` instead of `Send + Sync`
   This helps to assure that thread-local computations always work with the
   kind of types we provide. The ones that are carrying out actions are
   notably not `Sync` anymore.
   
   We cater to that by defining our bounds accordingly, but for those
   who want to use other utilities that need Sync, using types like
   `Repository` and `thread_local!()` is the only way to make this
   work.
