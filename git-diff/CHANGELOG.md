## 0.13.0 (2022-01-23)

<csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/>
<csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/>

### Changes (BREAKING)

 - remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - move git_pack::data::Object to git_object::Data, massively alter git_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.
