## 0.2.4 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

## 0.2.3 (2023-02-17)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-8a67c13bf0b9b8646430876768155f62e243ef52/> allow setting more information when preparing commands.
   This includes
   
   - disallowing the usage of a shell

</details>

## 0.2.2 (2023-01-09)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.2.1 (2022-12-30)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-8a67c13bf0b9b8646430876768155f62e243ef52/> allow setting more information when preparing commands.
   This includes
   
   - disallowing the usage of a shell

## 0.2.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.1.0 (2022-09-20)

The first usable release.

## 0.0.0 (2022-08-25)

Initial release to reserve the name.
