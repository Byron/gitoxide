## 0.39.0 (2023-12-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-bc44497606656cddc4f18a0acb272c34b8df4ba8/> trace credential helper invocations.
   This should make it easier to understand what's going on in case
   something isn't working as expected.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9e6ae011f9dc48fe8a79fe17b90cfaa6c9e1a64c/> `http::Error::InitHttpClient` adds a missing word that makes the message less confusing
   Also validate that a source is present.
 - <csr-id-95847091dc7e37ae6cafb07d698c27661953d530/> assure we flush before turning a writer into a reader.
   Otherwise it might be that the write-end still isn't flushed, so
   the receiver didn't get the message it's waiting on, which wouild
   cause us to deadlock while waiting for a response from the remote.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dfec2813f79cd52727d3e2d8b824b9277b4aae0e/> Add `ssl_verify` field to `client::http::Options`.
   Currently this option only works in the curl backend.
 - <csr-id-c3edef1c0c49accbb037bdf086dade3ed0e5e507/> make it possible to trace incoming and outgoing packetlines.
   Due to the way this is (and has to be) setup, unfortunately one
   has to integrate that with two crates, instead of just one.
   
   This changes touches multiple crates, most of which receive a single
   boolean as last argument to indicate whether the tracing should
   happen in the first place.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-88f8b342ab317696bcab8a0fe75c042e7290a75c/> Remove unsafe transmute of should_interrupt
   Adds a lifetime to the ExtendedBufRead trait to specify how long the
   callback provided must live.

## 0.38.0 (2023-10-13)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8011c73ee401bfca03811a249c46a4dd468af1b8/> bump `gix-transport` version to prevent it from being picked up.
   `gix-transport` v0.37.1 could accidentally be picked up by older, incompatible,
   `gix` versions which now fail to build.
   
   Thus v0.37.1 is now yanked and replaced with v0.38.0 along with a new
   release of `gix` to go with it.

## 0.32.0 (2023-06-06)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-aa2d0643a212a7a619890f3650c7d7005f8f8fd0/> parse 'handshake' of `file://` based protocol version 0.
   This special protocol kicks in when `git` serves `file://` directly
   and no version number is specified. Then it doesn't advertise capabilities
   at all, but shows 0000 right away.
   Make sure we can parse it, and show it by adding `Version::V0` as well.

## 0.30.0 (2023-04-26)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

## 0.28.0 (2023-03-10)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-72ec01b6e37e56fda72e8f137c92dc2276bc0791/> add `ReadLineBufRead::readline_str(&mut String)` to get consistent readline behaviour.
   Previously the `async` version of the transport implementation would use the default `read_line` implementation
   which would search for newlines in packetlines. However, these aren't always emitted which could lead to
   multiple packetlines to be concatenated.
   
   Now the we always use our implementation which simply treats one packet line as line, no matter whether
   or not it ends with optional newline.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-397ed90a36c0b86e2c9022b2787656746045c5a3/> Assure `ReadlineBufRead::readline_str()` calls our implementation for `Box<T: ReadlineBufRead>` as well.
   This fixes a bug where the HTTP implementation would incorrectly concatenate packetlines without newlines
   as sent by the server for shallow info lines.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-7830f1e112ed3c936b08ab53cd20b9eff7feb7d5/> HTTP transport uses url identity if username and password is set.
   Note that this also changes `http::Transport::new(...)` to accept a `gix_url::Url`
   instead of a string as it's typically the input and makes it easier to derive an
   identity.

## 0.25.6 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

## 0.25.5 (2023-02-17)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-3ee602d4cddaed69a875b76d8c941f51615b7048/> failure to set the http.version isn't critical.
   Failing to set the version isn't critical, and may indeed fail depending on the version
   of libcurl we are built against.
   Furthermore, `git` itself doesn't actually check for errors when configuring curl at all,
   treating all or most flags as non-critical.

## 0.25.4 (2023-02-17)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-08dcda254bc942dcc36d432cf7130c2ce4c6d54e/> `Capabiltiies::from_lines()` takes a single buffer.
   That way it doesn't have to convert to `String` as intermediary
   which may fail as illformed UTF8 might be present.
   
   Performance wise, reading all lines ahead of time, it is the same
   as it was before as it would collect all lines beforehand anyway.
   
   We are also seeing only a few lines in V2, and in V1 it was
   fully streaming already.
 - <csr-id-4308a209dddcbb461c34d45fb9af8b4621d4600a/> `max-pure` now builds without any C build tooling due to lack of `openssl-sys`.
   To make this work, we leave the `reqwest` configuration to downstream crates.
   Note that this means downstream will have to select their TLS settings
   themselves, so builds may fail after upgrade until this is done.
   
   An example for a `reqwest` configuration can be found in the
   `gitoxide` Cargo.toml in the root of the `gitoxide` repository.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6fa27642aa57613cae82ae680f02923dad25d474/> ptions for `client::connect()` and support for more than one ssh variant, including permission-denied detection.
   Options can be passed down to `client::ssh::connect()` to further configure it
   similar to what git itself offers. That way, it's possible to use different ssh commands
   and support all of gits configuration options.
   
   Support for multiple ssh variants was added to use them (and their flags) correctly.
   
   Detection of permission-denied errors due to invalid credentials was added so re-authentication
   in upper layers can be implemented.
 - <csr-id-041eca547a6629c8540728eba95dbcd636285ba9/> make streaming otional for any reqwest.
   One can now indicate when initiating a reqwest that the transport doesn't
   have to stream the data, even though it will always be provided to an
   `std::io::Write`.
   
   Note that this is at the discretion of the transport implementation and streaming
   might still be done despite it not being requested.
   
   Note that the caller should set this 'streaming' flag if the upper bound of data
   is high for keeping it in memory or can't be estimated. This is generally true
   when sending packs.
 - <csr-id-1204bfcaadd31ed198b923df05f19115da3754a4/> Provide support for reading packetlines directly.
   The handshake response itself now provides a `ref` read implementation
   with direct readline support. That way one can avoid having to go
   through `String`.
 - <csr-id-8e158c3f4056f59724fe91587157ef0daa517964/> interpret the FollowRedirects option for the curl HTTP backend.
   This comes with changes to the `HTTP` trait which now requires a base-url
   to be provided as well.
 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-78ad3df64f2c016ba17b158bd9ab1d2341aab399/> add `fetch::Transport::configure` to generically configure any transport.
 - <csr-id-32dc1829a5661f66396d109c8d0a8eaae6b1f532/> use `git-credentials` in `git-protocol`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-07512db093e62d9b9185368bd3fa561cfcd1d1d2/> `client::TransportWithoutIO::to_url()` returns `Cow<'_, BStr>`.
   That way, it's possible to efficiently return URLs in the right format,
   or return generates ones as needed.
 - <csr-id-fe2042bff9ae38bf76b76cef14986f9f76bded7d/> `client::TransportWithoutIO::to_url()` returns `BString`.
   That way it will not be lossy in case the URL represents a path, which
   is relevant for transports that refer to paths.
   
   Note that this doesn't matter when the url actually is a URL, as it's
   specified to be valid unicode (I think).
 - <csr-id-759b5d482de048deb24d14043a173079914e7ac8/> `client::TransportV2Ext::invoke()` supports owned `capabilities`.
   That way it's easier to pass custom agent strings when invoking.
 - <csr-id-1cf66c4dbc7a0404701efe4335363c2636ce32f8/> `client::http::connect()` returns `Transport<Impl>` directly.
   It' can't fail, so no need to return `Result<_, Infallible>`.
 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-9509ce4faeca8b4e1527bac625370403495bb03c/> `client::connect()` supports anything that parses into a `git_url::Url`; turn http url back to &str
   The http url is always valid UTF-8 and doesn't contain invalid paths,
   thus we should have the type system reflect that.
 - <csr-id-52e8c149ff17ce894cc30d03ead1988f52f0663e/> `client::connect()` now takes a `&BStr` as URL
 - <csr-id-71a43d0bc12661efcb9c94697c704f700a3be488/> use `thiserror` instead of `quickerror`
 - <csr-id-12589cc6f08e4d7aabae30bcdadaa0c2b4850229/> adapt to changes in `git-url` and use `BString` to represent URLs.
   They can contain paths, which is why `String` can't repsent a URL
   losslessly.
   
   For HTTP urls these are ultimately UTF-8 strings though.

### Other

 - <csr-id-5bef0a00e8d01110c054a517f6d9696f981a7efc/> try to make the transport configurable after being boxed, but…
   …that would force it to be 'static, which is something we excplicitly
   cannot have. We need references to be contained within, if I remember
   correctly.
 - <csr-id-2f3725efcaa439db4e10ade1b9fbeb1258fd93c1/> make capabilities parsing public

   - `schannel_check_revoke` as `curl`-backend specific configuration.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### Changed

 - <csr-id-28615b3bb9acff86d7a5520172513e3cc22aeda1/> `TransportV2Ext::invoke(…,features,…)` can take key-value pairs more flexibly.
   Value can now also be owned, which is useful if the value type is a
   `Cow<'_, String>`.

 - <csr-id-eff7ad79d8b920ab9d936d6268060cfc8ae1b47a/> make clear in docs that the writer needs to be dropped for good measure.
   Otherwise, some transports might deadlock.
 - <csr-id-acb4c170395779d1c34d74951121acd5c5b19c65/> Use single quotes for ssh path arg
   Git uses this method of quoting args for SSH transport too
   Some Git SSH servers require this method to be used (eg. BitBucket)
 - <csr-id-85c33825678bddde5a3fe409bbb1ff5cecd3a0fc/> Place port for PuTTY and derivates in separate argument
   All three PuTTY clients require the port to be separated from the "-P"
   argument
 - <csr-id-6ba799c9d6b17ed665d3c352c3c4bb35c9f771bb/> `gix clone ssh://...` won't deadlock anymore.
   For `cargo` specifically we now parse stderr to see if permission errors
   occour. This links stderr and stdout and we have to pass information from
   a supervisor thread that parses stderr to stdout and use the information to
   return a custom io error in time.
   Now the algorithm is adjusted to never be able to deadlock, as the problem
   is inherently racy and somewhat hard to implement it properly especially without
   a good test suite built-into `gitoxde` - there are no ssh servers one can easily
   spin up cross-platform.
 - <csr-id-ec2f2e31a714334bc0942eab08d306d4e0952933/> file:// command invocation won't spill stderr output.
   This usually doesn't add any benefit to the user as we might see
   events like the git process' failure to flush to a closed channel
   even though this is entirely handled by the Rust side of things.
   
   I can imagine that one day this might become a configurable to help
   with debugging to help making better-behaved clients, but maybe it
   won't ever matter once the default file:// transport is built-in and
   native.
 - <csr-id-fed38c90df546c4bfc57ef66c92b4c9312c90586/> improve error message for when an invoked transport program can't be found.
 - <csr-id-f0997bfab2ba66fb12b0c9d4d673faeabda9687c/> assure processing thread is up before continuing.
   That way one may hope that we never leave stderr output unprocessed.
 - <csr-id-923278b4f245c31245a83f5f4d6e3b7dce8134e2/> port selections for SSH urls are now respected for protocol V1 as well.
 - <csr-id-0ff127c62c2cc47b93ef4af108a382c62af1d3fb/> propery adjust `host` argument for `ssh` program to include a user name.
   Otherwise it would not use a user at all which then defaults to the currently logged
   in user, something that typically won't work with servers that demand `git`.
 - <csr-id-c62e5c7d415351aefafeb75f0ab926c7c45c6ede/> fixes SSH clone from scp-like/relatives URLs
   - Removes git-upload-pack extra parameters (rejected by both github and gitlab)

## 0.25.3 (2023-01-10)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.25.2 (2023-01-09)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-6ba799c9d6b17ed665d3c352c3c4bb35c9f771bb/> `gix clone ssh://...` won't deadlock anymore.
   For `cargo` specifically we now parse stderr to see if permission errors
   occour. This links stderr and stdout and we have to pass information from
   a supervisor thread that parses stderr to stdout and use the information to
   return a custom io error in time.
   Now the algorithm is adjusted to never be able to deadlock, as the problem
   is inherently racy and somewhat hard to implement it properly especially without
   a good test suite built-into `gitoxde` - there are no ssh servers one can easily
   spin up cross-platform.

## 0.25.1 (2022-12-31)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ec2f2e31a714334bc0942eab08d306d4e0952933/> file:// command invocation won't spill stderr output.
   This usually doesn't add any benefit to the user as we might see
   events like the git process' failure to flush to a closed channel
   even though this is entirely handled by the Rust side of things.
   
   I can imagine that one day this might become a configurable to help
   with debugging to help making better-behaved clients, but maybe it
   won't ever matter once the default file:// transport is built-in and
   native.

## 0.25.0 (2022-12-30)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-fed38c90df546c4bfc57ef66c92b4c9312c90586/> improve error message for when an invoked transport program can't be found.
 - <csr-id-f0997bfab2ba66fb12b0c9d4d673faeabda9687c/> assure processing thread is up before continuing.
   That way one may hope that we never leave stderr output unprocessed.
 - <csr-id-923278b4f245c31245a83f5f4d6e3b7dce8134e2/> port selections for SSH urls are now respected for protocol V1 as well.
 - <csr-id-0ff127c62c2cc47b93ef4af108a382c62af1d3fb/> propery adjust `host` argument for `ssh` program to include a user name.
   Otherwise it would not use a user at all which then defaults to the currently logged
   in user, something that typically won't work with servers that demand `git`.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6fa27642aa57613cae82ae680f02923dad25d474/> ptions for `client::connect()` and support for more than one ssh variant, including permission-denied detection.
   Options can be passed down to `client::ssh::connect()` to further configure it
   similar to what git itself offers. That way, it's possible to use different ssh commands
   and support all of gits configuration options.
   
   Support for multiple ssh variants was added to use them (and their flags) correctly.
   
   Detection of permission-denied errors due to invalid credentials was added so re-authentication
   in upper layers can be implemented.

## 0.24.2 (2022-12-26)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d59d362f12bf617656bae80596120c8bf823b090/> add and implement various new http options for the `curl` backend.
   - `schannel_check_revoke` as `curl`-backend specific configuration.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c62e5c7d415351aefafeb75f0ab926c7c45c6ede/> fixes SSH clone from scp-like/relatives URLs
   - Removes git-upload-pack extra parameters (rejected by both github and gitlab)

## 0.24.1 (2022-12-22)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.24.0 (2022-12-19)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-0a2b135d19ce1f1b4b0394befaa3949906322c97/> improve granularity of IO errors for `curl` backends.
   That way it should be possible to tell if `curl` caused
   an IO error due to someting that can be considered spurious.
 - <csr-id-9a2f7cd55c05f2fdb0ae62f0efca9dfa451694c7/> `IsSpuriousError` trait and its implementation.
   That way all transports can tell if the operation failed due to
   an issue that's probably passing, so retrying may be a way to resolve
   the issue.
 - <csr-id-5034544b36994177009ccc8d6c07cb000b429174/> `client::http::Options::no_proxy` to disable a proxy for given hosts.
   This is a curl-first option which can reasonably be implemented for other backends
   as well and thus retains its curl-ish roots in full.
 - <csr-id-e701e7e9cc571108ca210fc0ca23494d6a1c7208/> `client::http::Options::verbose` to see more debug output.
   This means different things depending on the backend, and for
   `curl` it means a lot of debug-output on stderr.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ff0332e815c228cc5cdfe58c3598ad261bb2879e/> http transports can now reuse a connection.
   This makes connections more efficient generally and `cargo` relies
   on that behaviour in their tests as well.
 - <csr-id-85dcda81d3fec03ad5687b0e0329cefedd925722/> don't pre-configure curl.
   These settings can interact strangly with other users of the curl package
   within the same dependency tree, so it's paramount to only activate features
   we truly need.
 - <csr-id-0d0eb4aa46b265f97ada7b54d8bcc29decc42e50/> ssh connection remove '=' in port argument
 - <csr-id-4927adf1a57166b581fc293a33f84ef628af70db/> make it possible to parse handshakes without newlines in packetlines #(639)
 - <csr-id-7ab7c2409a47fae587531c0c3b203cd646e32984/> correctly display what's actual and expected when failing to parse capabilities.
 - <csr-id-b0083e38c82829b4d8b81542fc8d1025089e2869/> improve compile-time errors if mutually exclusive http-client features are set.
 - <csr-id-5f2276b63129163096be3cb229864fc589348da8/> don't enforce V2 as protocol, but smoothly downgrade like git does.
   For backward compatibility the shared handshake implementation allows the
   transport to control which protocol versions it wants to support
   to allow optimizing for one special case, namely to prevent it to
   read all V1 refs on old servers but abort instead, closing the connection
   without delay.
   
   Now we leave this feature for custom transports (who usually come with custom
   servers) and instead support fallbacks to other protocols if the server
   demands it.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-1204bfcaadd31ed198b923df05f19115da3754a4/> Provide support for reading packetlines directly.
   The handshake response itself now provides a `ref` read implementation
   with direct readline support. That way one can avoid having to go
   through `String`.
 - <csr-id-8e158c3f4056f59724fe91587157ef0daa517964/> interpret the FollowRedirects option for the curl HTTP backend.
   This comes with changes to the `HTTP` trait which now requires a base-url
   to be provided as well.
 - <csr-id-041eca547a6629c8540728eba95dbcd636285ba9/> make streaming otional for any reqwest.
   One can now indicate when initiating a reqwest that the transport doesn't
   have to stream the data, even though it will always be provided to an
   `std::io::Write`.
   
   Note that this is at the discretion of the transport implementation and streaming
   might still be done despite it not being requested.
   
   Note that the caller should set this 'streaming' flag if the upper bound of data
   is high for keeping it in memory or can't be estimated. This is generally true
   when sending packs.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-08dcda254bc942dcc36d432cf7130c2ce4c6d54e/> `Capabiltiies::from_lines()` takes a single buffer.
   That way it doesn't have to convert to `String` as intermediary
   which may fail as illformed UTF8 might be present.
   
   Performance wise, reading all lines ahead of time, it is the same
   as it was before as it would collect all lines beforehand anyway.
   
   We are also seeing only a few lines in V2, and in V1 it was
   fully streaming already.

## 0.23.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-68ed6d7e2cabc3d3bc78a29003863cd4194549fa/> Support for proxy authentication in http configuration.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4308a209dddcbb461c34d45fb9af8b4621d4600a/> `max-pure` now builds without any C build tooling due to lack of `openssl-sys`.
   To make this work, we leave the `reqwest` configuration to downstream crates.
   Note that this means downstream will have to select their TLS settings
   themselves, so builds may fail after upgrade until this is done.
   
   An example for a `reqwest` configuration can be found in the
   `gitoxide` Cargo.toml in the root of the `gitoxide` repository.

## 0.22.0 (2022-11-17)

### Changed

 - <csr-id-28615b3bb9acff86d7a5520172513e3cc22aeda1/> `TransportV2Ext::invoke(…,features,…)` can take key-value pairs more flexibly.
   Value can now also be owned, which is useful if the value type is a
   `Cow<'_, String>`.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-42acc88bbc63850c0d38db70bc46b1058875e2a0/> `client::RequestWriter::into_parts()` to obtain a bare write handled along with a buf reader with packetline capabilties.
   That way it's possible to perform interactions akin to a V1 puash.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-07512db093e62d9b9185368bd3fa561cfcd1d1d2/> `client::TransportWithoutIO::to_url()` returns `Cow<'_, BStr>`.
   That way, it's possible to efficiently return URLs in the right format,
   or return generates ones as needed.
 - <csr-id-fe2042bff9ae38bf76b76cef14986f9f76bded7d/> `client::TransportWithoutIO::to_url()` returns `BString`.
   That way it will not be lossy in case the URL represents a path, which
   is relevant for transports that refer to paths.
   
   Note that this doesn't matter when the url actually is a URL, as it's
   specified to be valid unicode (I think).
 - <csr-id-759b5d482de048deb24d14043a173079914e7ac8/> `client::TransportV2Ext::invoke()` supports owned `capabilities`.
   That way it's easier to pass custom agent strings when invoking.

## 0.21.2 (2022-11-08)

### Fixes

- enable clones from `kernel.org` via `https`. This failed as it wouldn't send the service announcement in protocol V2, 
  which was thought to be mandatory at least when judging from `github.com`.

## 0.21.1 (2022-11-06)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-375051fa97d79f95fa7179b536e616c4aefd88e2/> Allow `client::connect()` to function with `http-client-reqwest` enabled.
 - <csr-id-4b5d6dfb58f325bba692e1e32636c24ba058022f/> `client::Capabilities` lifetimes now point to `'a` instead of `'self`.
   This generally makes returned values longer, and as long as one would
   expect.

## 0.21.0 (2022-10-10)

<csr-id-5bef0a00e8d01110c054a517f6d9696f981a7efc/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-8e17534b0efa7418eabdc36f89bab9f9db7b2c38/> `reqwest` as blocking HTTP backend via `http-client-reqwest` feature toggle.
   Note that despite passing the same tests that `curl` passes, for
   bulletproof HTTP connections to untrusted servers, the `curl` backend
   should be preferred. `reqwest` is known to hang if `content-length:`
   HTTP headers are longer than the actual content, and no timeout is
   kicking in to stop the hanging. `curl` has no trouble with this for
   example.
 - <csr-id-0fd57c6b491a3c8d0127bc1d1f0eb958437edff9/> Add `client::http::Transport::new_http()` constructor.
   This goes along with `client::http::connect_http()` to support
   connections to via custom transports which are passed from calling
   crates, without relying on the implementation to be built-in.
 - <csr-id-e05c1fefeed23dbedf0420e04a2a408510775380/> Allow defaulting `client::Capabilities`.
   This can be useful in conjunction with `std::mem::take()`, even
   though an empty data structure like that doesn't bear any significance
   beyond that.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-41b0c19e1aca9406015932862058756af2a26dda/> set the protocol version for local git transports as well.
   Previously this was only done for ssh based connections, and requires
   setting an environment variable.
 - <csr-id-6d8b66a9bee901eb8cb869e6e28dbb25988f1fed/> remove `Drop` for `SpawnProcessOnDemand`.
   It is well-intended but is likely to hang the calling process
   if for any reason not all process output was consumed.
   
   Even though not waiting for the process leaves it running, it will
   stop naturally once its output pipe breaks once once
   our handles for it are inevitable dropped at the same time.
 - <csr-id-237682a529dc54e33e4738f34915d872aeb89514/> compare 'Content-Type' header case-insensitively, as required by the http spec.

### Other

 - <csr-id-5bef0a00e8d01110c054a517f6d9696f981a7efc/> try to make the transport configurable after being boxed, but…
   …that would force it to be 'static, which is something we explicitly
   cannot have. We need references to be contained within, if I remember
   correctly.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-1cf66c4dbc7a0404701efe4335363c2636ce32f8/> `client::http::connect()` returns `Transport<Impl>` directly.
   It' can't fail, so no need to return `Result<_, Infallible>`.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-78ad3df64f2c016ba17b158bd9ab1d2341aab399/> add `fetch::Transport::configure` to generically configure any transport.

## 0.20.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

## 0.19.3 (2022-08-28)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.19.2 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-5220f9a59fb699e111342b076145a6899d36d433/> Make async `conenct()` signature compatible with the blocking implementation.

## 0.19.1 (2022-08-17)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9509ce4faeca8b4e1527bac625370403495bb03c/> `client::connect()` supports anything that parses into a `gix_url::Url`; turn http url back to &str
   The http url is always valid UTF-8 and doesn't contain invalid paths,
   thus we should have the type system reflect that.
 - <csr-id-52e8c149ff17ce894cc30d03ead1988f52f0663e/> `client::connect()` now takes a `&BStr` as URL
 - <csr-id-71a43d0bc12661efcb9c94697c704f700a3be488/> use `thiserror` instead of `quickerror`
 - <csr-id-12589cc6f08e4d7aabae30bcdadaa0c2b4850229/> adapt to changes in `gix-url` and use `BString` to represent URLs.
   They can contain paths, which is why `String` can't represent a URL
   losslessly.
   
   For HTTP urls these are ultimately UTF-8 strings though.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f6a6a499f20e12e2bcca734bdf3c8599d37f6a6f/> `connect()` method is available in when `async-std` feature is set along with `async-client`
   This makes some async support available even trough the base crate,
   which otherwise would require establishing a connection (with a runtime
   of choice) by hand.

## 0.19.0 (2022-07-22)

This is a maintenance release with no functional changes.

## 0.18.0 (2022-06-13)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.17.0 (2022-05-18)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-32dc1829a5661f66396d109c8d0a8eaae6b1f532/> use `gix-credentials` in `gix-protocol`

## 0.16.0 (2022-04-03)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-39778fd76191cfdb60df87eab8da59e575e48c78/> in-manifest and in-lib documentation of feature toggles

## 0.15.0 (2022-01-23)

A maintenance release with no relevant changes.

## 0.14.0 (2021-11-29)

A maintenance release, triggered by putting too many adjustments into a single commit.

## 0.13.1 (2021-11-16)

A maintenance release triggered by changes to gix-pack and changelog rewrites.

## v0.13.0 (2021-10-19)

A maintenance release due to properly dealing with previously breaking changes in `gix-hash`.

## v0.12.0 (2021-10-15)

### Dependency Upgrade (BREAKING)

* `gix-traverse` saw a breaking change moving to v0.9, which triggered this crate to signal a breaking change, too.

### Improvements

* `gix-packetline` is now publicly re-exported as `packetline`.
  
  This helps to avoid additional dependencies which in turn may have breaking
  changes. Re-using `packetline` assures it's usable.

## v0.11.1 (2021-08-29)

- instruct docs.rs which features to use for more useful documentation

## v0.11.0 (2021-08-27)
