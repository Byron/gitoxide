//! Git stores all of its data as _Objects_, which are data along with a hash over all data. Thus it's an
//! object store indexed by the signature of data itself with inherent deduplication: the same data will have the same hash,
//! and thus occupy the same space within the store.
//!
//! There is only one all-round object store, also known as the [`Store`], as it supports ~~everything~~ most of what git has to offer.
//!
//! * loose object reading and writing
//! * access to packed objects
//! * multiple loose objects and pack locations as gathered from `alternates` files.

/// ### Features
///
/// - entirely lazy, creating an instance does no disk IO at all if [`Slots::Given`][store::init::Slots::Given] is used.
/// - multi-threaded lazy-loading of indices and packs
/// - per-thread pack and object caching avoiding cache trashing.
/// - most-recently-used packs are always first for speedups if objects are stored in the same pack, typical for packs organized by
///   commit graph and object age.
/// - lock-free reading for perfect scaling across all cores, and changes to it don't affect readers as long as these don't want to
///   enter the same branch.
/// - sync with the state on disk if objects aren't found to catch up with changes if an object seems to be missing.
///    - turn off the behaviour above for all handles if objects are expected to be missing due to spare checkouts.
