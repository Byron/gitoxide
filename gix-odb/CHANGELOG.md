## 0.52.0 (2023-09-08)

<csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/>

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/> update to the latest `prodash`
   It makes proper usage of `Progress` types easier and allows them to be used
   as `dyn` traits as well.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.44.0 (2023-04-26)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-07e11cf210682337f777f1cbbc0d25794c1179ca/> set permissions of newly written loose objects to be similar to `git`.
   Note that the current implementation lacks all of the sophistication that git
   applies, and doing this properly definitely takes more work as we would need
   to support `core.sharedRepository`.
   
   Further, our tempfile implementation doesn't allow the setup of file modes
   right when it matters, so that could mean quite some work to either workaround
   or contribute.
 - <csr-id-416ceccf7eaf1946efed5a2c95461a2690ae367a/> collisions of newly written object's don't trigger collisions anymore.
   It's solved by special-casing windows and assume that certain kinds of filesystem errors
   are the result of a collision (with some degree of concurrency/contention).

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

<csr-id-c800fdd331e6d7a0b8d756ba822915259f26e9e8/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/> remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - <csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/> move git_pack::data::Object to git_object::Data, massively alter git_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.
 - <csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/> move loose header manipulation from git-pack to git-object

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-1fabdc51b9468ba2c6b8cf74509ad5aa2a0b86f4/> `alternate::resolve(…)` now takes the current_dir as argument.
   That way it's more consistent with similar low-level functions and it's
   possible to avoid multiple calls to `std::env::current_dir()`.
   
   Furthermore, the usage of `current_dir()` is made explicit when
   instantiating a store to allow it to be resued.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d9d05b0db6b4453e7385117d466bf7c2e8de81fa/> add `Store::try_header()` for obtaining object information quickly.
   Note that this feature also comes with various refactorings related to the error
   type used by various methods in order to get away from a 'one error fits all' kind
   of situation.
 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-95210cb2ba85f75148b4ef48ccea9d9f8a0a0114/> Provide optional `candidates` for ambigious entries during `lookup_prefix()`
   The candidate entries are all entries matching a given prefix.
 - <csr-id-92d8be1101a7e76e70cd90db6a943b9e31e20802/> `loose::Db` and `Store` can return all candidate objects for a single prefix
   This is the first step towards auto-disambiguating objects in rev-parse.
 - <csr-id-bf73a94b43288b6634dbb33f2433656987a73baf/> `Cache::inner` removed in favor of `Deref/Mut` and `into_inner()`
   Making the `inner` field available allows changing it, which would make
   it potentially incompatible with existing caches. The new
   implementation makes it essentially read-only while allowing more
   convenient access to methods on `inner`.

### Changed (BREAKING)

<csr-id-ab4e726fcec65871a81056a9c69af8ea3f56b2a3/>
<csr-id-8bb5c9a75cd91ae0d888bc8e93707cfc9cc08090/>
<csr-id-580e96c1b2d9782a2e8cf9d1123f6d53a5376a3d/>
<csr-id-3f05fea55dc8acce1ed62ecbe4e0a1394f2720b7/>

 - <csr-id-8c5ae77f06a64c57df9a9ad1190266896a223dbe/> Remove deprecated compound and linked object databases
   The dynamic/general store is the only maintained can-do-it-all
   DB now.
 - <csr-id-91d047658b114f372735116c9d8e6962a3873137/> cleanup and unify `verify_integrity()` method signature
   Previously they used many different ways of handling their parameters
   despite all boiling down to calling the same 'index::File::traverse()`
   method.
   
   This allows for more reuse of `Options` structs and generally makes
   clearer how these optinos are used.
 - <csr-id-2ef9a8424af51310db8c1e6df31dde9953ed3d21/> Change accessors named `hash_kind()` to `object_hash()` for consistency
 - <csr-id-49998cce419a27f3928ec4ac39da5e3b500e5cb2/> consistently use `object_hash` instead of `hash_kind`
 - <csr-id-67c42fbf5f88f8dc42a9ebd7c6276d57ba1d4624/> remove `Write::*(…, hash_kind)`
   The `hash_kind` is now intrinsic to the implementation of the write
   trait and thus isn't passed along anymore in parameters.
   
   The `sink()` function now takes the kind of hash as parameter.
 - <csr-id-ad1b9ea17eb4b98ebd2fddebe82a8fee1d63e9dd/> various changes to the `loose::Store`
   - Change `path` field to read-only `path()` method

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-46636e64c9a48ec0e85e014ac0cc8b48846d8462/> flatten errors into one
   By adding one variant, one can remove the previous 'sub-error', for which
   there is no precedent in the codebase yet.
 - <csr-id-e0b8636f96e4bfe1bc72b5aa6ad4c4c8538ff92c/> replace bare u32 `data::Id` typedef
 - <csr-id-5d57c1f7e3b9a84f7b46a4378015572155f3104b/> Use borrowed::Id in trees for full type safety
 - <csr-id-47ca6ab2ff0cbf8801d0a82cebbbeb8c4f62cdae/> a simpler implementation to skip the header

### Other

 - <csr-id-2d6960f886c1165f0bdb6f2d653388e1e0b57a2d/> try LRU-like contains implementation
   Which unfortunately isn't really faster at all even though it totally
   should be.
 - <csr-id-424c9b3a2b467f5a1e339700257cd4ab72e2e692/> Try to make Handle usable for pack creation
   It's nearly there, but for some reason the boxed dyn traits don't get to
   be Send even though it's specified.
 - <csr-id-b1c82a7959fba1541642fc8dfae46b27848f2ba3/> :Find for Arc and Rc
 - <csr-id-9235106986e14551a28693bfe4ea92f046c65406/> :Find implementation for linked::Store
 - <csr-id-747a13e9a1fe5200c53055dd961507c9fef667e1/> :borrowed::Object => git-odb::data::Object
 - <csr-id-4c77e4c97641ab3b02b56aaa702a7d2ca5bced7c/> :Db::init() with a few tests
 - <csr-id-d53c4b0f91f1b29769c9430f2d1c0bcab1170c75/> add link to simplified/polonius version in the docs
 - <csr-id-b317200b72096573d511d229c6e61e74e7ba14db/> Only check alternates for objects not found in packs or loose
   This matches the behavior of git.
 - <csr-id-eaae9c1bc723209d793eb93f5587fa2604d5cd92/> Avoid double-lookup in packs without polonius
   Split object lookup into two steps: looking up the object index, and
   looking up the object itself given the index. This avoids passing in the
   buffer (and thus looking like an unconditional borrow to non-polonius)
   until we're committed to returning from the loop.
 - <csr-id-13159eb972ed78ce4ebee2313b288023cec91c47/> try to get rid of tree-traversal Boxed error…
   …which really complicates things downstream as these now have to deal
   with another type argument, or of to try to turn it into a Box anyway.
   
   The latter seems to be…troubling so I can't make it compile.
 - <csr-id-0092c256b3bfaf2818566540e660cdefcf68d246/> See if tree compaction saves considerable amounts of memory
   No, it's not worth it.
 - <csr-id-9945eba749afb020e0deaaa5bb01fda6ff9ccd84/> try to use a customized version of just pieces of Miniz-oxide
 - <csr-id-cfd8a25f9125c48afe4b66eab6b6ecf71097c486/> fanout table, but slowly I get it :D
 - <csr-id-1525f36d29574699d2fcb16b70678121030fd109/> discard idea of making traversal even more generic
 - <csr-id-4ff21686c32a6edc84ea041c3040f33ae24f9519/> first silly attempt to randomly remove an allocation
 - <csr-id-91c8fc1f0c50af55d7cb233bbe813c6d12fe11bc/> get rid of failure crate in favor of quick-error

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-4fffa9a9198cf3012fa8215796aab3d456519ff3/> remove panic-assertions in `loose` `lookup_prefix`
 - <csr-id-1ce3190000f6211ce31468c7603d491bb5b90293/> Disable tag.gpgSign in test scripts
   This is done for the same reason that commit.gpgsign is disabled for test
   scripts. It prevents test failures if the user has tag.gpgsign enabled in
   their global git config when invoking tests.
 - <csr-id-41d494365d281056c5e9466860db808bd85143e9/> improve error messages when objects aren't found
 - <csr-id-9c14de391a1a9f1055922164d1757c9aa9720807/> support Rust 1.52
 - <csr-id-b605c1fa0494b10872d3c2e6ecce0e39f1a90a9e/> linked::Store now assures unique IDs across compound stores

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-c800fdd331e6d7a0b8d756ba822915259f26e9e8/> remove unused dependencies

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d792ea543246632bf1ca8d0e1d239bbe7f07e219/> use enumerations to advertise progress ids publicly.
   Previously these were an implementation detail which also means they
   couldn't be relied upon.
   
   Thanks to an intermediate enumeration, they become part of the public API
   and their actual value is not exposed.
 - <csr-id-e9d1f45e944e91bb9715a3ee89a4f28b09250411/> support for pack-order when iterating objects.
 - <csr-id-7f19bd7e63d78e3151e43d5094ae9d35cbe34f46/> add `loose::Store::try_header()` to obtain loose object information without content.
 - <csr-id-c8835c6edae784c9ffcb69a674c0a6545dbb2af3/> upgrade to `prodash 21.1` and add `Ids` to all progress instances.
   That way callers can identify progress they are interested in, say, for
   selective visualizations.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-81e1a9d38aac9e6dd0618266ff826593e038cce8/> Add `Cache::has_object_cache()` and `Cache::has_pack_cache()` methods.
   That way it's possible to conditionally set or change the cache size.
 - <csr-id-84ec54e904378c5b3d7da9efff66b02e88b16916/> Handle::packed_object_count()
   Provide packed objects numbers and cache the value
   for fast access later on.
 - <csr-id-996bfb3061fd9ee2cf38c93f39e0d4c7c6163386/> loose::Store::lookup_prefix(…)
 - <csr-id-58c2edb76755ab71e10eef4cd9a51533825c291f/> git_pack::Find::try_find_cached(…, pack_cache)
   With this method it's easier to bypass local caches and control
   the cache oneself entirely.
 - <csr-id-36fde720c34e02429a810ddd43b894a37516f51a/> add linked::Store::rc_iter()
   For completeness in case of single-threaded operations
 - <csr-id-a81b33359a4394a66f854195445f8f9aa0a46179/> linked::Store sorts bundles by modification date, newest first
 - <csr-id-e25f4eadec679406aad6df10026e27e4832c2482/> A simplified version of the `Find` trait
   It's meant for the next generation of object db handles which keep a
   local cache of all the details of the actual object database.

## 0.38.1 (2022-12-26)

<csr-id-46636e64c9a48ec0e85e014ac0cc8b48846d8462/>

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-4fffa9a9198cf3012fa8215796aab3d456519ff3/> remove panic-assertions in `loose` `lookup_prefix`

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-46636e64c9a48ec0e85e014ac0cc8b48846d8462/> flatten errors into one
   By adding one variant, one can remove the previous 'sub-error', for which
   there is no precedent in the codebase yet.

## 0.38.0 (2022-12-19)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e9d1f45e944e91bb9715a3ee89a4f28b09250411/> support for pack-order when iterating objects.
 - <csr-id-7f19bd7e63d78e3151e43d5094ae9d35cbe34f46/> add `loose::Store::try_header()` to obtain loose object information without content.
 - <csr-id-c8835c6edae784c9ffcb69a674c0a6545dbb2af3/> upgrade to `prodash 21.1` and add `Ids` to all progress instances.
   That way callers can identify progress they are interested in, say, for
   selective visualizations.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d9d05b0db6b4453e7385117d466bf7c2e8de81fa/> add `Store::try_header()` for obtaining object information quickly.
   Note that this feature also comes with various refactorings related to the error
   type used by various methods in order to get away from a 'one error fits all' kind
   of situation.

## 0.37.0 (2022-11-21)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-1ce3190000f6211ce31468c7603d491bb5b90293/> Disable tag.gpgSign in test scripts
   This is done for the same reason that commit.gpgsign is disabled for test
   scripts. It prevents test failures if the user has tag.gpgsign enabled in
   their global git config when invoking tests.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-1fabdc51b9468ba2c6b8cf74509ad5aa2a0b86f4/> `alternate::resolve(…)` now takes the current_dir as argument.
   That way it's more consistent with similar low-level functions and it's
   possible to avoid multiple calls to `std::env::current_dir()`.
   
   Furthermore, the usage of `current_dir()` is made explicit when
   instantiating a store to allow it to be reused.

 - <csr-id-81e1a9d38aac9e6dd0618266ff826593e038cce8/> Add `Cache::has_object_cache()` and `Cache::has_pack_cache()` methods.
   That way it's possible to conditionally set or change the cache size.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-41d494365d281056c5e9466860db808bd85143e9/> improve error messages when objects aren't found

 - <csr-id-95210cb2ba85f75148b4ef48ccea9d9f8a0a0114/> Provide optional `candidates` for ambiguous entries during `lookup_prefix()`
   The candidate entries are all entries matching a given prefix.
 - <csr-id-92d8be1101a7e76e70cd90db6a943b9e31e20802/> `loose::Db` and `Store` can return all candidate objects for a single prefix

 - <csr-id-e0b8636f96e4bfe1bc72b5aa6ad4c4c8538ff92c/> replace bare u32 `data::Id` typedef

### Other

 - <csr-id-2d6960f886c1165f0bdb6f2d653388e1e0b57a2d/> try LRU-like contains implementation

   should be.
 - <csr-id-424c9b3a2b467f5a1e339700257cd4ab72e2e692/> Try to make Handle usable for pack creation
   It's nearly there, but for some reason the boxed dyn traits don't get to

 - <csr-id-58c2edb76755ab71e10eef4cd9a51533825c291f/> gix_pack::Find::try_find_cached(…, pack_cache)
   With this method it's easier to bypass local caches and control
   the cache oneself entirely.
 - <csr-id-36fde720c34e02429a810ddd43b894a37516f51a/> add linked::Store::rc_iter()
   For completeness in case of single-threaded operations
 - <csr-id-a81b33359a4394a66f854195445f8f9aa0a46179/> linked::Store sorts bundles by modification date, newest first
 - <csr-id-e25f4eadec679406aad6df10026e27e4832c2482/> A simplified version of the `Find` trait

   local cache of all the details of the actual object database.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9c14de391a1a9f1055922164d1757c9aa9720807/> support Rust 1.52
 - <csr-id-b605c1fa0494b10872d3c2e6ecce0e39f1a90a9e/> linked::Store now assures unique IDs across compound stores

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-91d047658b114f372735116c9d8e6962a3873137/> cleanup and unify `verify_integrity()` method signature
   Previously they used many different ways of handling their parameters
   despite all boiling down to calling the same 'index::File::traverse()`
   method.
   
   This allows for more reuse of `Options` structs and generally makes
   clearer how these options are used.
 - <csr-id-2ef9a8424af51310db8c1e6df31dde9953ed3d21/> Change accessors named `hash_kind()` to `object_hash()` for consistency
 - <csr-id-49998cce419a27f3928ec4ac39da5e3b500e5cb2/> consistently use `object_hash` instead of `hash_kind`
 - <csr-id-67c42fbf5f88f8dc42a9ebd7c6276d57ba1d4624/> remove `Write::*(…, hash_kind)`
   The `hash_kind` is now intrinsic to the implementation of the write
   trait and thus isn't passed along anymore in parameters.
   
   The `sink()` function now takes the kind of hash as parameter.
 - <csr-id-ad1b9ea17eb4b98ebd2fddebe82a8fee1d63e9dd/> various changes to the `loose::Store`.
   
   Change `path` field to read-only `path()` method
   add `hash_kind` parameter to `loose::Store::at(…, hash_kind)`
 - <csr-id-ab4e726fcec65871a81056a9c69af8ea3f56b2a3/> move `sink::Sink` to the top-level exclusively
 - <csr-id-8bb5c9a75cd91ae0d888bc8e93707cfc9cc08090/> move `loose::iter::Iter` to `loose::Iter`
 - <csr-id-3f05fea55dc8acce1ed62ecbe4e0a1394f2720b7/> remove `make_object_cache` parameter from `gix_pack::data::output::count::objects()`
   It now is an implementation detail of the Find trait.
 - <csr-id-580e96c1b2d9782a2e8cf9d1123f6d53a5376a3d/> Rename `Handle` to `Cache`
   Because this is exactly what it is effectively.
   Also add some basic instantiation for the new object store.
 - remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - move gix_pack::data::Object to gix_object::Data, massively alter gix_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bf73a94b43288b6634dbb33f2433656987a73baf/> `Cache::inner` removed in favor of `Deref/Mut` and `into_inner()`
   Making the `inner` field available allows changing it, which would make
   it potentially incompatible with existing caches. The new
   implementation makes it essentially read-only while allowing more
   convenient access to methods on `inner`.

## 0.25.0 (2021-11-29)

<csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/>

Maintenance release due, which isn't really required but one now has to be careful what's committed at once.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - move loose header manipulation from gix-pack to gix-object

## 0.24.0 (2021-11-16)

A maintenance release triggered by changes to gix-pack and changelog rewrites.

## v0.23.0 (2021-10-19)

A maintenance release to properly dealing with previously breaking changes in `gix-hash`.

## v0.22.0 (2021-10-15)

### Dependency Upgrade (BREAKING)

* `gix-traverse` saw a breaking change moving to v0.9, which triggered this crate to signal a breaking change, too.

### Improvements

* pack-ids as generated when instantiating a compound database are now sequential. That way, they never clash which
  was possible before when it was using a CRC32 over the filename.

  The latter was done to allow deduplicating packs, but it turns out not to be necessary just yet.

   This matches the behavior of git.
 - <csr-id-eaae9c1bc723209d793eb93f5587fa2604d5cd92/> Avoid double-lookup in packs without polonius
   Split object lookup into two steps: looking up the object index, and
   looking up the object itself given the index. This avoids passing in the
   buffer (and thus looking like an unconditional borrow to non-polonius)
   until we're committed to returning from the loop.
