## 0.25.0 (2023-10-12)

This release contains a complete rewrite of the internal url parsing logic, the public interface stays mostly the same however. Gitoxide will now be
more correct, interpreting more urls the same way Git does. Improvements include the added support for ssh aliases (`github:byron/gitoxide` has previously
been parsed as local path), adjustments around the interpretation of colons in file names (previously we disallowed colons that were not followed up
with a slash character) and some smaller changes that bring the interpretation of file urls more in line with Git's implementation. Additionally, the
error types have been adjusted to print a more comprehensive message by default, making sure they stay helpful even when bubbled up through multiple abstraction
layers.

There are still many (edge) cases in Git's url parsing implementation which are not handled correctly by Gitoxide. If you notice any such deviation please
open a new issue to help us making Gitoxide even more correct.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ea0ea88dfc232601b462fcf52fed4d34a17bc116/> another fuzz-issue that could cause long parse times of URLs
 - <csr-id-60126d7097280bf364fb83ef73588df414198855/> denial of service attack by passing a URL with a very long host.
   We now check for certain size limits and prevent passing long URLs to
   the `url` crate.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4184a5e9019f2ac20213b5362d60c71e0bf295d3/> enable fuzzing for git url parsing

## 0.22.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-313a7b3ddc5786af1f120fa99dd659d725b6845a/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-229bd4899213f749a7cc124aa2b82a1368fba40f/> don't call crate 'WIP' in manifest anymore.

### Reverted (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-fb0b8a769a8992e8079c66fea7d4708d9db0323d/> url parsing error NotALocalFile
   The `NotALocalFile` error variant was previously returned if the input
   url contained a colon but the slice after that character contained no
   slash character (`/` or `\`). This behavior is wrong.
   
   SCP like URLs may not need a slash character to specify the repositories
   location. Similarly, a local directory that contains a colon in its name
   is a valid repository path as well.
   
   The new implementation correctly parses such URLs.
 - <csr-id-dd1a1257d66d2f280be0adfce0a100a6a83e1c65/> url parsing error MissingResourceLocation
   The `MissingResourceLocation` error variant was previously returned if
   the input URL had either scheme ssh (no matter if URL or SCP format) or
   git and the URL contained no or an empty path section. In the future we
   will instead return the `MissingRepositoryPath` error in such a case.
   
   The only benefit of such a seperation is that it allows the caller to
   infer the kind of URL we tried to parse. A future commit will add a new
   field to the `MissingRepositoryPath` error variant which will clearly
   communicate this information and can therefore be used instead for this
   purpose.

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-313a7b3ddc5786af1f120fa99dd659d725b6845a/> restructure gix-url parsing error variants
   All error variants now own a copy of the input which is used in their
   display implementation. I noticed that URL parsing errors are almost never
   acted upon but only wrapped and bubbled up to the user. It therefore
   makes sense to ensure the message for this error is informative enough
   by default.
   
   If an error can be thrown for different types of URLs it now also
   includes a kind field. With this field the caller can determine what
   kind of URL we tried to parse. Additionally, this information is used
   for the error message too.
   
   For testing the assert_matches crate was added which implements the
   unstable feature with the same name in stable rust. It makes testing the
   invalid variants much more convenient.
   
   BREAKING because public fields of some error variants are now no longer
   available

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-8857580cb270b737bf04437a6f5e65307df1c99b/> let `Url::canonicalize(d)()` take the current working dir as argument.
   That way it's free of side-effects and can be used properly from `gix::Repository`

## 0.17.0 (2023-04-26)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

## 0.13.3 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2da6c862e184ac37d59147e9cf809017b65db966/> make Scheme work with serde, removing `Copy` in the process.  e#450)
   This wasn't supposed to happen but a requirement to get `serde` support
   back.
 - <csr-id-2bcfdee6a3af758a0b70e2af9c4b6f8cc09d8da0/> Prohibit invalid state by making parts the url's data private
   This fix is meant to improve serialization support which can now happen
   `to_bstring()` without possibility for error.
   
   Empty paths can still be set which won't be valid for all URLs.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-96a265cc67ea787ed28adde2c5d0a07babf64c9e/> generalize extension schemes.
   Previously this was hard-coded to `radicle`, now it's just an extension
   scheme along with a statically known string. This means we have to
   explicitly support new formats which should be fine.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-653ebc52f97116e9c72e985eda0d76f566e8c74d/> Introduce `parse(&BStr)` (previously it took `&[u8]`)
   A `&BStr` better indicates that we are expecting human-readable input
   with ascii-compatible or UTF-8 endcoding.
 - <csr-id-f6506e0c463bdccbcfd9324bc312da9cc957d8e6/> Use `&BStr` as input instead of `[u8]`
   This signals that it's indeed intended to be human readable while
   allowing it to be a path as well without loss, at least theoretically.
   After all we currently don't have a way to parse invalid UTF-8.
 - <csr-id-79ab4aeb8206a5f32735891336d7745e046bbea1/> remove `impl std::fmt::Display for Url` as it's not lossless.
 - <csr-id-ffc4a85b9a914b685d7ab528b30f2a3eefb44094/> `From<&[u8]>` is now `From<&BStr>`
   This better represents the meaning of the input, and simplifies
   interactions with `git-config`.

### Other

 - <csr-id-098f802e6dc9f55632791ddf8d046563f75cba7a/> try for leaner tests, but it does the opposite kind of :D

### New Features

 - <csr-id-61d89f586a0ad913fc2f502520282520a5e1fd15/> collect ssh-specific options to control how the ssh program is invoked.
   These are passed through when creating the ssh transport.
 - <csr-id-01f25744bba45a5f8a8615734a5beeacd29d1c4e/> add `Url::canonicalized()` and `Url::canonicalize()`.
   These methods allow to assure file urls are absolute, useful when
   cloning from any url.
 - <csr-id-22d3b37ea6239170a478b859361a7d1d7ba01a9a/> `Url::try_from(path: &std::path::Path)` for more convenient instantiation.
 - <csr-id-39ce98ba9a427b8cea1b843f333c2e7de300499c/> (mostly) lossless roundtripping of scp-like urls.
   Previously `git@host:path` would turn into `ssh://git@host/path`,
   which now remains exactly as is.
 - <csr-id-58a6000d669acd33bad91509eaa469f041f119e5/> lossless serialization of file urls.
   Previously a url like `/path/to/repo` would serialize to
   `file:///path/to/repo`, preventing round-trips.
   
   Now it serializes like it was parsed. This also means that
   `file://path` still serializes as `file://path`.
 - <csr-id-7484db5d36383de450de31b4c94c01bc4c237ce4/> `Url::port_or_default()` to fill in default numbers for ports if possible.
 - <csr-id-fbe75c9457708b95dd833e00afa2dcc1db677167/> `Url::path_is_root()` to determine if the path is `/`.
   This could also be considered an empty path depending on the context

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-372cea13ad8abe1c47ed7bc806b42292a8ebfae0/> correctly parse scp-like ssh urls with alias as such.
   Previously it would falsely consider it a file path, leading to
   the inability to use the URL at all.
   
   Now the initial scheme detection has been improved to not rely on
   the '.' in host names exclusively anymore.
 - <csr-id-1058330adcc3262c59d30a0b8854fade20ffc3d5/> properly set default SSH port to 22
 - <csr-id-f20f2728ee78d90510e27769a61ead405c4018c1/> scp-like URLs should preserve relative and home-relative paths
 - <csr-id-302a2d866692a541e01d112b6870aa22fcdbe32b/> reject empty paths where needed, add `Url::from_parts_as_alternative_form()`.
   The new constructor allows to create URLs that represent paths which otherwise couldn't
   be valid URLs.
 - <csr-id-3e3aff9f2f427d030a38fe147c5252d7bfd45109/> make sure that `file:..` isn't considered a valid file url.
 - <csr-id-d6f90beac37866f992a1714d38e5b320eea6f1bb/> handle `file:///C:/foo/bar` urls correctly on windows, as paths now are `C:\\foo\bar`.
   These paths are created when using the `url::Url::from_file_path()`
   family of methods, which adds an extra slash at the beginning of a
   windows path which makes it invalid there unless there is further
   processing.
   
   This is now applied by using `url` features, making this case work
   specifically. Note that all other attributes are still the same
   and `git-url` generally tries to keep paths in tact to be a hybrid
   of type that can handle any file system paths as well as actual urls.

</details>

## 0.13.1 (2023-01-10)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.13.0 (2022-12-30)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-61d89f586a0ad913fc2f502520282520a5e1fd15/> collect ssh-specific options to control how the ssh program is invoked.
   These are passed through when creating the ssh transport.

## 0.12.2 (2022-12-26)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-1058330adcc3262c59d30a0b8854fade20ffc3d5/> properly set default SSH port to 22

## 0.12.1 (2022-12-22)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.12.0 (2022-12-19)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-302a2d866692a541e01d112b6870aa22fcdbe32b/> reject empty paths where needed, add `Url::from_parts_as_alternative_form()`.
   The new constructor allows to create URLs that represent paths which otherwise couldn't
   be valid URLs.
 - <csr-id-3e3aff9f2f427d030a38fe147c5252d7bfd45109/> make sure that `file:..` isn't considered a valid file url.
 - <csr-id-d6f90beac37866f992a1714d38e5b320eea6f1bb/> handle `file:///C:/foo/bar` urls correctly on windows, as paths now are `C:\\foo\bar`.
   These paths are created when using the `url::Url::from_file_path()`
   family of methods, which adds an extra slash at the beginning of a
   windows path which makes it invalid there unless there is further
   processing.
   
   This is now applied by using `url` features, making this case work
   specifically. Note that all other attributes are still the same
   and `gix-url` generally tries to keep paths in tact to be a hybrid
   of type that can handle any file system paths as well as actual urls.
 - <csr-id-f20f2728ee78d90510e27769a61ead405c4018c1/> scp-like URLs should preserve relative and home-relative paths

## 0.11.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.10.1 (2022-11-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-01f25744bba45a5f8a8615734a5beeacd29d1c4e/> add `Url::canonicalized()` and `Url::canonicalize()`.
   These methods allow to assure file urls are absolute, useful when
   cloning from any url.

## 0.10.0 (2022-10-10)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-22d3b37ea6239170a478b859361a7d1d7ba01a9a/> `Url::try_from(path: &std::path::Path)` for more convenient instantiation.
 - <csr-id-39ce98ba9a427b8cea1b843f333c2e7de300499c/> (mostly) lossless roundtripping of scp-like urls.
   Previously `git@host:path` would turn into `ssh://git@host/path`,
   which now remains exactly as is.
 - <csr-id-58a6000d669acd33bad91509eaa469f041f119e5/> lossless serialization of file urls.
   Previously a url like `/path/to/repo` would serialize to
   `file:///path/to/repo`, preventing round-trips.
   
   Now it serializes like it was parsed. This also means that
   `file://path` still serializes as `file://path`.

## 0.9.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

## 0.8.0 (2022-09-04)

A major release to properly introduce the signature change that happened in 0.7.2, which effectively
broke compilation for users of `parse()` in 0.7.1.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7484db5d36383de450de31b4c94c01bc4c237ce4/> `Url::port_or_default()` to fill in default numbers for ports if possible.
 - <csr-id-fbe75c9457708b95dd833e00afa2dcc1db677167/> `Url::path_is_root()` to determine if the path is `/`.
   This could also be considered an empty path depending on the context
   which is what makes it useful.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-653ebc52f97116e9c72e985eda0d76f566e8c74d/> Introduce `parse(&BStr)` (previously it took `&[u8]`)
   A `&BStr` better indicates that we are expecting human-readable input
   with ascii-compatible or UTF-8 endcoding.

## 0.7.3 (2022-08-28)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.7.2 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2da6c862e184ac37d59147e9cf809017b65db966/> make Scheme work with serde, removing `Copy` in the process.  e#450)
   This wasn't supposed to happen but a requirement to get `serde` support
   back.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-96a265cc67ea787ed28adde2c5d0a07babf64c9e/> generalize extension schemes.
   Previously this was hard-coded to `radicle`, now it's just an extension
   scheme along with a statically known string. This means we have to
   explicitly support new formats which should be fine.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7a1769009d68d14a134f368f93245abab0fb41dd/> `TryFrom<&OsStr>` to allow direct usage of `Url` in `clap`.
   In `clap_derive`, this needs
   `parse(try_from_os_str = std::convert::TryFrom::try_from)`.
 - <csr-id-b7a5f7a3b5cf058f503cc18d18fc75356ab98955/> `TryFrom<PathBuf>` which is useful if urls are obtained from the command-line.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-d40f6e1f34eb3f4664caec36727bf0aa3a396a33/> `Scheme::try_from(&str)`

## 0.7.1 (2022-08-17)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2bcfdee6a3af758a0b70e2af9c4b6f8cc09d8da0/> Prohibit invalid state by making parts the url's data private
   This fix is meant to improve serialization support which can now happen
   `to_bstring()` without possibility for error.
   
   Empty paths can still be set which won't be valid for all URLs.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-f6506e0c463bdccbcfd9324bc312da9cc957d8e6/> Use `&BStr` as input instead of `[u8]`
   This signals that it's indeed intended to be human readable while
   allowing it to be a path as well without loss, at least theoretically.
   After all we currently don't have a way to parse invalid UTF-8.
 - <csr-id-79ab4aeb8206a5f32735891336d7745e046bbea1/> remove `impl std::fmt::Display for Url` as it's not lossless.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-a67fc26b80e5d1183ddc5c6598396214f3e19945/> more conversions for `TryFrom`: `String` and `&str`
 - <csr-id-833899dce120d26a2bbe04d07fc4c71455eb3afe/> `Url::write_to(out)` to write itself more flexibly.
 - <csr-id-5f707c7e99c70ab9683d55c396e8dc11e1d3b0ea/> Add `Url::to_bstring()` for lossless but fallible bstring conversion.

## 0.7.0 (2022-07-22)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ffc4a85b9a914b685d7ab528b30f2a3eefb44094/> `From<&[u8]>` is now `From<&BStr>`
   This better represents the meaning of the input, and simplifies
   interactions with `gix-config`.
