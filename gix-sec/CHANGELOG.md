## 0.7.0 (2023-04-26)

<csr-id-d0fb3c86e3601c5cf27a33efe05ddd82eef34528/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-d0fb3c86e3601c5cf27a33efe05ddd82eef34528/> Bump dependencies

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.
 - <csr-id-bb8cccca7f8e6a986b16e1213c0f9b075d128da3/> upgrade to `windows` v0.48

## 0.6.3 (2023-02-17)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

## 0.6.2 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-136eb37b00c9e7ba0fd0bc2a75dee2ac1b06516d/>
<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-266d4379e9132fd7dd21e6c8fccb36e125069d6e/> Make `realpath()` easier to use by introducing `realpath_opt()`.
   That way there is consistency about how many symlinks to follow.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-33f8b9292946329ca2b24c5f0b2877db9afa2a15/> remove `Perrmission::fmt()` (Display)
   It was somewhat specific to being printed in the error scenario, and
   not general purpose at all.
 - <csr-id-51c721cccc4754e55ec9cb30344f75d7b07fc2a7/> `permission::Error<R>` with only one generic parameter
   As this error is only used for `Permission`, it's clear that it
   contains a `Permission` instance.
 - <csr-id-ac3823d7e0dcd1e51a373c9adca1a7476ca79003/> remove `thiserror` optional feature.
   It's now included by default even though it's only used for a single
   error type.
   The reasoning is that `git-sec` is used within a tree that uses
   `thiserror` anyway, so no need to optimize compile times for the case
   where it doesn't.
 - <csr-id-0f0bca3652f0e46dbebcb46956aa9c32e8812abe/> Remove `Access` without replacement.
   It's a clear case of over-engineering and it didn't prove to be useful
   at all.
 - <csr-id-f00f4a4a3a9149bf5cf925e931a8105aeb9b9db9/> simplify `Permission` type radically `
 - <csr-id-37a607db7c09ab897f306e3bbd4e0ca4e4387bae/> remove `Identity` in favor of `identity::Account` module; add `identity::UserId`
   As the fewest consumers will be able to deal with multiple identities,
   remove the enumeration approach in favor of individual type which deal
   with one specific way of identifying a user.

### Other

 - <csr-id-136eb37b00c9e7ba0fd0bc2a75dee2ac1b06516d/> adopt git-for-windows exception rules

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9a1e9828e813ec1de68ac2e83a986c49c71c5dbe/> on windows, emit a `NotFound` io error, similar to what happens on unix.
   That way code relying on this behaviour will work the same on both
   platforms.
   
   On windows, this costs at an additional metadata check.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fe24b41bae244884f1f2cea43af11ab27976b9bc/> `Permission::is_allowed()` as convenience method
 - <csr-id-515e52145b2bd0e484af232de4cd8450a1e7cbf2/> `Permissions::check_opt()` for those who don't need an error case.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-3d16c36d7288d9a5fae5b9d23715e043d4d8ce76/> Support for SUDO_UID as fallback for ownership check on unix.
 - <csr-id-95577e20d5e62cb6043d32f6a7b9023d827b9ce4/> A shared `permission::Error` type
 - <csr-id-de0226ab863f3d5d6688f1b89aa3ebc9bfdf1f34/> `permission::Error`
   A lightweight, general purpose error to display permissions violations
   that cause errors. This should make it useable across crates.
 - <csr-id-f6077978fd5697bd113a894ba68492213becea41/> obtain identities `from_path()` or `from_process()`
 - <csr-id-cdf3c3e42433a85e8b47b9dc5558f5c76df3c6ae/> add `Identity` type

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

</details>

## 0.6.1 (2023-01-10)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.6.0 (2022-12-19)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.5.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.4.2 (2022-11-06)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.4.1 (2022-10-10)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.4.0 (2022-09-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fe24b41bae244884f1f2cea43af11ab27976b9bc/> `Permission::is_allowed()` as convenience method
 - <csr-id-515e52145b2bd0e484af232de4cd8450a1e7cbf2/> `Permissions::check_opt()` for those who don't need an error case.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-33f8b9292946329ca2b24c5f0b2877db9afa2a15/> remove `Perrmission::fmt()` (Display)
   It was somewhat specific to being printed in the error scenario, and
   not general purpose at all.
 - <csr-id-51c721cccc4754e55ec9cb30344f75d7b07fc2a7/> `permission::Error<R>` with only one generic parameter
   As this error is only used for `Permission`, it's clear that it
   contains a `Permission` instance.
 - <csr-id-ac3823d7e0dcd1e51a373c9adca1a7476ca79003/> remove `thiserror` optional feature.
   It's now included by default even though it's only used for a single
   error type.
   The reasoning is that `gix-sec` is used within a tree that uses
   `thiserror` anyway, so no need to optimize compile times for the case
   where it doesn't.
 - <csr-id-0f0bca3652f0e46dbebcb46956aa9c32e8812abe/> Remove `Access` without replacement.
   It's a clear case of over-engineering and it didn't prove to be useful
   at all.

## 0.3.1 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

## 0.3.0 (2022-07-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3d16c36d7288d9a5fae5b9d23715e043d4d8ce76/> Support for SUDO_UID as fallback for ownership check on unix.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9a1e9828e813ec1de68ac2e83a986c49c71c5dbe/> on windows, emit a `NotFound` io error, similar to what happens on unix.
   That way code relying on this behaviour will work the same on both
   platforms.
   
   On windows, this costs at an additional metadata check.

## 0.2.0 (2022-06-13)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-266d4379e9132fd7dd21e6c8fccb36e125069d6e/> Make `realpath()` easier to use by introducing `realpath_opt()`.
   That way there is consistency about how many symlinks to follow.

## 0.1.2 (2022-05-27)

<csr-id-136eb37b00c9e7ba0fd0bc2a75dee2ac1b06516d/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-136eb37b00c9e7ba0fd0bc2a75dee2ac1b06516d/> adopt git-for-windows exception rules

## 0.1.1 (2022-05-21)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.1.0 (2022-05-18)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-95577e20d5e62cb6043d32f6a7b9023d827b9ce4/> A shared `permission::Error` type
 - <csr-id-de0226ab863f3d5d6688f1b89aa3ebc9bfdf1f34/> `permission::Error`
   A lightweight, general purpose error to display permissions violations
   that cause errors. This should make it useable across crates.
 - <csr-id-f6077978fd5697bd113a894ba68492213becea41/> obtain identities `from_path()` or `from_process()`
 - <csr-id-cdf3c3e42433a85e8b47b9dc5558f5c76df3c6ae/> add `Identity` type

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-f00f4a4a3a9149bf5cf925e931a8105aeb9b9db9/> simplify `Permission` type radically `
 - <csr-id-37a607db7c09ab897f306e3bbd4e0ca4e4387bae/> remove `Identity` in favor of `identity::Account` module; add `identity::UserId`
   As the fewest consumers will be able to deal with multiple identities,
   remove the enumeration approach in favor of individual type which deal
   with one specific way of identifying a user.

## 0.0.0 (2022-04-15)

An empty crate without any content to reserve the name for the gitoxide project.
