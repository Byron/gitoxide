## Unreleased

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fe24b41bae244884f1f2cea43af11ab27976b9bc/> `Permission::is_allowed()` as convenience method
 - <csr-id-515e52145b2bd0e484af232de4cd8450a1e7cbf2/> `Permissions::check_opt()` for those who don't need an error case.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-33f8b9292946329ca2b24c5f0b2877db9afa2a15/> remove `Perrmission::fmt()` (Display)
   It was somewhat specific to being printed in the error scenario, and
   not general purpose at all.
 - <csr-id-51c721cccc4754e55ec9cb30344f75d7b07fc2a7/> `permission::Error<R>` with only one generic parameter
   As this error is only used for `Permission`, it's clear that it
   contains a `Permission` instance.
 - <csr-id-ac3823d7e0dcd1e51a373c9adca1a7476ca79003/> remove `thiserror` optional feature.
   It's now included by default even though it's only used for a single
   error type.
   The reasoning is that `git-sec` is used within a tree that uses
   `thiserror` anyway, so no need to optimize compile times for the case
   where it doesn't.
 - <csr-id-0f0bca3652f0e46dbebcb46956aa9c32e8812abe/> Remove `Access` without replacement.
   It's a clear case of over-engineering and it didn't prove to be useful
   at all.

## 0.3.0 (2022-07-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3d16c36d7288d9a5fae5b9d23715e043d4d8ce76/> Support for SUDO_UID as fallback for ownership check on unix.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9a1e9828e813ec1de68ac2e83a986c49c71c5dbe/> on windows, emit a `NotFound` io error, similar to what happens on unix.
   That way code relying on this behaviour will work the same on both
   platforms.
   
   On windows, this costs at an additional metadata check.

## 0.1.0 (2022-05-18)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-95577e20d5e62cb6043d32f6a7b9023d827b9ce4/> A shared `permission::Error` type
 - <csr-id-de0226ab863f3d5d6688f1b89aa3ebc9bfdf1f34/> `permission::Error`
   A lightweight, general purpose error to display permissions violations
   that cause errors. This should make it useable across crates.
 - <csr-id-f6077978fd5697bd113a894ba68492213becea41/> obtain identities `from_path()` or `from_process()`
 - <csr-id-cdf3c3e42433a85e8b47b9dc5558f5c76df3c6ae/> add `Identity` type

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-f00f4a4a3a9149bf5cf925e931a8105aeb9b9db9/> simplify `Permission` type radically `
 - <csr-id-37a607db7c09ab897f306e3bbd4e0ca4e4387bae/> remove `Identity` in favor of `identity::Account` module; add `identity::UserId`
   As the fewest consumers will be able to deal with multiple identities,
   remove the enumeration approach in favor of individual type which deal
   with one specific way of identifying a user.
