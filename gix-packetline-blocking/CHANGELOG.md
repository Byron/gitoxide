## 0.17.0 (2023-12-06)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c3edef1c0c49accbb037bdf086dade3ed0e5e507/> make it possible to trace incoming and outgoing packetlines.
   Due to the way this is (and has to be) setup, unfortunately one
   has to integrate that with two crates, instead of just one.
   
   This changes touches multiple crates, most of which receive a single
   boolean as last argument to indicate whether the tracing should
   happen in the first place.

## 0.16.5 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-145125ab79526a6191a9192a6faa7fe1a8826935/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-145125ab79526a6191a9192a6faa7fe1a8826935/> use `faster-hex` instead of `hex`
   The performance here certainly doesn't make a difference, but we
   try to avoid duplicate dependencies.
