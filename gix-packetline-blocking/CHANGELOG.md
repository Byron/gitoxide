## 0.17.2 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
   They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
   unecessarily can break downstream CI.
   
   Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
   more recent features are actually used.

## 0.17.0 (2023-12-06)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c3edef1c0c49accbb037bdf086dade3ed0e5e507/> make it possible to trace incoming and outgoing packetlines.
   Due to the way this is (and has to be) setup, unfortunately one
   has to integrate that with two crates, instead of just one.
   
   This changes touches multiple crates, most of which receive a single
   boolean as last argument to indicate whether the tracing should
   happen in the first place.
