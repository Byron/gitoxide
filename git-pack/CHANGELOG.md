<csr-id-c800fdd331e6d7a0b8d756ba822915259f26e9e8/>

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-e0b8636f96e4bfe1bc72b5aa6ad4c4c8538ff92c/> replace bare u32 `data::Id` typedef

### Chore

 - <csr-id-c800fdd331e6d7a0b8d756ba822915259f26e9e8/> remove unused dependencies

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b80dec2323b81fb2172df76c7d897a4b5e6bdfea/> zero-objects check for index and multi-index integrity validation
 - <csr-id-56fc99fb9c1cab61abd03c10e1b4af0d6e491bbf/> support for fan-checking in index and multi-index integrity verification
 - <csr-id-28e3ea8612112f6a04cfaff591565eca5a1ffba2/> introduce type for entry indices within an index or multi-index
   That way it's a littl emore descriptive than a bare u32.
 - <csr-id-58c2edb76755ab71e10eef4cd9a51533825c291f/> git_pack::Find::try_find_cached(…, pack_cache)
   With this method it's easier to bypass local caches and control
   the cache oneself entirely.
 - <csr-id-e25f4eadec679406aad6df10026e27e4832c2482/> A simplified version of the `Find` trait
   It's meant for the next generation of object db handles which keep a
   local cache of all the details of the actual object database.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-42e0487286c1f745837c0ce337ed7c9d86b14516/> support Rust 1.52
 - <csr-id-84ade1d23060f10bf6c8529f8f693d06660b4f4e/> Allow resolution of in-pack ref-deltas
   This finally allows delta tree caches to be used on typical small packs
   returned by GitHub.
 - <csr-id-ba92cc09ba41fe4c9a9097bfeb8d18016408fcdf/> don't try to short-cut detection of large offsets when writing index files
   The code incorrectly assumed that the input is sorted by offsets, with
   the largest offset being last, even though by all means that's not the
   case.
 - <csr-id-6d3f52dc13d7243a6bce6dab89a985114a75d94b/> Avoid the dashmap being cloned for each thread
   Intead, share it by reference, it's sync after all.
   
   This issue was introduced when switching to a `Send + Clone` model,
   instead of `Send + Sync`, to allow thread-local caches in database
   handles of all kinds.
 - <csr-id-b605c1fa0494b10872d3c2e6ecce0e39f1a90a9e/> linked::Store now assures unique IDs across compound stores

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-a79a7fb638b45df88af0d0d5fc9ada6d824bc328/> Improve method signatures of `cache::Tree::*`
 - <csr-id-91d047658b114f372735116c9d8e6962a3873137/> cleanup and unify `verify_integrity()` method signature
   Previously they used many different ways of handling their parameters
   despite all boiling down to calling the same 'index::File::traverse()`
   method.
   
   This allows for more reuse of `Options` structs and generally makes
   clearer how these optinos are used.
 - <csr-id-2cf7727228e1d8094ffd2eec6746006348c39eab/> `index::File::traverse()` now returns an `Outcome` struct instead of tuple of 3 fields
 - <csr-id-bf04644ab75ed1969507f957dc8d4868790d462d/> remove `Option<impl Progress>` in favor of `impl Progress`
 - <csr-id-6829e5e5d6aed1e6c87647144e2dd76a1e4b9f1f/> multi-index integrity check; use `integrity::Outcome` for various integrity checks
 - <csr-id-d851bede97801096d188ff6af06c98a79fe276db/> remove unnecessary `Arc` around `should_interrupt` flag
 - <csr-id-c2679a03358b9c19d63ed1af1cd57324c6381447/> remove Sha1 mentions in `index::verify::Mode::*` variants
   The hash is repository defined and not hard-coded
 - <csr-id-80b120d3278e46429f848df7af3db13413c36649/> introduce `index::File::verify_integrity(…, pack: Option<PackContext>, …)`, replacing tuple
   This allows for more documentation on what input is required there and
   generally makes for an easier to use API.
 - <csr-id-79dc0d5ba6fa31ddd5c075693ffdc6496c1eaded/> rename `oid::try_from()` to `try_from_bytes()`, add `from_bytes_unchecked()`
   This change was done in the name of consistency, as `from_bytes()` is
   used in many other git-* crates
 - <csr-id-2ef9a8424af51310db8c1e6df31dde9953ed3d21/> Change accessors named `hash_kind()` to `object_hash()` for consistency
 - <csr-id-b76f6be6c5baa6cf613a174241f007e92bf5ba36/> consistently use `object_hash` instead of `hash_kind`
 - <csr-id-629412b4cb192614b7eff08dbf203e3448c902c1/> data::Entry::from_read() now takes a hash lengths as parameter
   That way ref-deltas can be interepreted without hard-coding SHA1
 - <csr-id-851dc2c52fa8e204ba2d5ced8fb0959a889869d8/> data::Entry::from_bytes(…, hash_len) takes new parameter
   The hash-len tells it how to interpret ref-delta objects, which
   store the complete hash of the base object.
   
   This is now entirely configurable.
 - <csr-id-db8c8c41b4ced0fc296d3877883d801e77d550ae/> `index::File::at()` with git_hash::Kind parameter
   It will allow to assume different hashes even in the index file format
   which isn't yet capable of storing this information.
 - <csr-id-e6a3c9f72332b524b143bc94ee9df0a6db11e864/> `data::File::at()` and `Bundle::at()` now have `hash_kind` parameter
   It's used to configure the kind of hash to assume when reading packs and
   indices.
 - <csr-id-3f05fea55dc8acce1ed62ecbe4e0a1394f2720b7/> remove `make_object_cache` parameter from `git_pack::data::output::count::objects()`
   It now is an implementation detail of the Find trait.
 - <csr-id-82b9b33bd5f4c3c1721a5093de2cedc62cb10565/> move `bundle::Location` to `data::entry::Location`
   The latter place best describes its purpose.
 - remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - move git_pack::data::Object to git_object::Data, massively alter git_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.

## 0.15.0 (2021-11-29)

<csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/>

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e7526b2a7b51cbac4018e1ab3b623a85987fadc2/> parallel utilities now use `Send + Clone` instead of `Send + Sync`.
   
   This helps to assure that thread-local computations always work with the
   kind of types we provide. The ones that are carrying out actions are
   notably not `Sync` anymore.
   
   We cater to that by defining our bounds accordingly, but for those
   who want to use other utilities that need Sync, using types like
   `Repository` and `thread_local!()` is the only way to make this
   work.

## 0.14.0 (2021-11-16)

<csr-id-e8b091943f0c9a26317da0003f7fcdf5a56ef21a/>

An important bugfix to prevent assertion failures when writing thin packs.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-20b3994206aa5bc5e35cbbc9c8f8f99187077f79/> Adjust size-hints of resolving entries iterator and use the upper bound in delta tree.
   
   The delta-tree is a data structure that actually heavily relies on
   favorable allocation and a known amount of objects in order to
   provide front and back buffers. However, this is an implementation
   detail and they don't have to stay consistent at all especially
   after growing the buffer by pushing to it.
   
   Interestingly, the VecDeque internally over-allocates as well which
   definitely helps the example of `as_mut_slices()`, otherwise
   it could also suffer from the assertions that trigger here.

## v0.12.0 (2021-10-15)

<csr-id-d8fe8141e80a9e9a433b5e1a072b850325c806c8/>
<csr-id-faf6f813927720c5adf62102f9ce46606ff2617c/>

<csr-id-8fe461281842b58aa11437445637c6e587bedd63/>

This release contains bugfixes and features, but is considered breaking as `git-traverse`
signalled a breaking change which is one of our dependencies.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-71c628d46088ab455b54eb2330d24dcff96c911d/> Use 'cache::Object' trait where it matters
 - <csr-id-8fe461281842b58aa11437445637c6e587bedd63/> split data::output::count::objects into files

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d6c44e6ab8f436020d4fb235e423b018fd1e7a9f/> dynamically sized full-object speeds up diff-based object counting
   which is what happens when counting objects for fetches where only changed objects should be sent.
 - <csr-id-50cf610e8939812c3d2268c48835e2dac67d0c31/> `cache::Object` trait for caching and retrieving whole objects
 - <csr-id-60c9fad8002b4e3f6b9607bba6361871752f4d3d/> control pack and object cache size in megabytes
 - <csr-id-5a8c2da6cb1e2accf7cfdccc16bc3a1d0b2a7dbc/> object cache size is configurable

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d8fe8141e80a9e9a433b5e1a072b850325c806c8/> don't put more objects into the pack cache than needed.
   
   Previously when accessing a packed object, it would store the base
   object into the pack cache (if it wasn't retrieved from there)
   which is great if that operation is free.
   
   Since it isn't, it's better not to stress the cache with puts
   and trash more objects than necessary.
   
   Now only the last decompressed object will be put into the LRU cache.
 - <csr-id-faf6f813927720c5adf62102f9ce46606ff2617c/> don't include submodules in count,
   which avoids dealing with missing objects entirely. Those ominous missing objects where just git submodules after all.
   
   It's still a good idea to handle these gracefully though, git itself
   seems to ignore them, too, and so do we at least for now.

### Performance

 - <csr-id-f9232acf8e52f8cd95520d122469e136eb07b39f/> ObjectID specific hashers, using the fact that object ids are hashes
