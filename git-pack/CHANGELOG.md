## v0.12.0 (2021-10-15)

<csr-id-d8fe8141e80a9e9a433b5e1a072b850325c806c8/>
<csr-id-faf6f813927720c5adf62102f9ce46606ff2617c/>
<csr-id-2f2d856efe733d3cf81110c0e0607d2e7c40d968/>

This release contains bugfixes and features, but is considered breaking as `git-traverse`
signalled a breaking change which is one of our dependencies.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d6c44e6ab8f436020d4fb235e423b018fd1e7a9f/> dynamically sized full-object speeds up diff-based object counting
   which is what happens when counting objects for fetches where only changed objects should be sent.
 - <csr-id-50cf610e8939812c3d2268c48835e2dac67d0c31/> `cache::Object` trait for caching and retrieving whole objects
 - <csr-id-60c9fad8002b4e3f6b9607bba6361871752f4d3d/> control pack and object cache size in megabytes
 - <csr-id-5a8c2da6cb1e2accf7cfdccc16bc3a1d0b2a7dbc/> object cache size is configurable

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d8fe8141e80a9e9a433b5e1a072b850325c806c8/> don't put more objects into the pack cache than needed.
   
   Previously when accessing a packed object, it would store the base
   object into the pack cache (if it wasn't retrieved from there)
   which is great if that operation is free.
   
   Since it isn't, it's better not to stress the cache with puts
   and trash more objects than necessary.
   
   Now only the last decompressed object will be put into the LRU cache.
 - <csr-id-faf6f813927720c5adf62102f9ce46606ff2617c/> don't include submodules in count,
   which avoids dealing with missing objects entirely. Those ominous missing objects where just git submodules after all.
   
   It's still a good idea to handle these gracefully though, git itself
   seems to ignore them, too, and so do we at least for now.

### Performance

 - <csr-id-f9232acf8e52f8cd95520d122469e136eb07b39f/> ObjectID specific hashers, using the fact that object ids are hashes
