/// High level `git-config` reader and writer.

/// This is the full-featured implementation that can deserialize, serialize,
/// and edit `git-config` files without loss of whitespace or comments.
///
/// # Multivar behavior
///
/// `git` is flexible enough to allow users to set a key multiple times in
/// any number of identically named sections. When this is the case, the key
/// is known as a "multivar". In this case, `raw_value` follows the
/// "last one wins" approach that `git-config` internally uses for multivar
/// resolution.
///
/// Concretely, the following config has a multivar, `a`, with the values
/// of `b`, `c`, and `d`, while `e` is a single variable with the value
/// `f g h`.
///
/// ```text
/// [core]
///     a = b
///     a = c
/// [core]
///     a = d
///     e = f g h
/// ```
///
/// Calling methods that fetch or set only one value (such as [`raw_value`])
/// key `a` with the above config will fetch `d` or replace `d`, since the last
/// valid config key/value pair is `a = d`:
///
/// ```
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// # use std::convert::TryFrom;
/// # let git_config = git_config::File::try_from("[core]a=b\n[core]\na=c\na=d").unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(git_config.raw_value("core", None, "a").unwrap(), Cow::Borrowed("d".as_bytes()));
/// ```
///
/// Consider the `multi` variants of the methods instead, if you want to work
/// with all values instead.
