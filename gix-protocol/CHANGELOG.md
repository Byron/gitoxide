## 0.42.0 (2023-12-06)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-6295dec2bdd6c3bb35e45db7a486651ebfe50369/> V1 negotiation won't hang anymore
   The logic previously tried to estimate when a pack can be expected,
   and when a NAK is the end of a block, or the beginning of a pack.
   
   This can be known because a pack (with our settings) needs two things:
   
   * the server thinks it's ready
* a `done` sent by the client

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c3edef1c0c49accbb037bdf086dade3ed0e5e507/> make it possible to trace incoming and outgoing packetlines.
   Due to the way this is (and has to be) setup, unfortunately one
   has to integrate that with two crates, instead of just one.
   
   This changes touches multiple crates, most of which receive a single
   boolean as last argument to indicate whether the tracing should
   happen in the first place.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-88f8b342ab317696bcab8a0fe75c042e7290a75c/> Remove unsafe transmute of should_interrupt
   Adds a lifetime to the ExtendedBufRead trait to specify how long the
   callback provided must live.

## 0.41.1 (2023-10-13)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8011c73ee401bfca03811a249c46a4dd468af1b8/> bump `gix-transport` version to prevent it from being picked up.
   `gix-transport` v0.37.1 could accidentally be picked up by older, incompatible,
   `gix` versions which now fail to build.
   
   Thus v0.37.1 is now yanked and replaced with v0.38.0 along with a new
   release of `gix` to go with it.

## 0.39.0 (2023-09-08)

<csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/>

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/> update to the latest `prodash`
   It makes proper usage of `Progress` types easier and allows them to be used
   as `dyn` traits as well.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-24dd870919ba444aa8099c63a78ea120d47ec28e/> use `prodash::Count` to indicate that nothing more than counting is performed, in place of `prodash::Progress`

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.37.0 (2023-08-02)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d1f9c63f8a79dcb00766d94edda80ed9add724ea/> add `fetch::Arguments::add_feature()` for unconditional additions of arguments that are supposed to be features.
   This differentiation is important to support V1 and V2 correctly, which have a different notion of features with V1
   special-casing them, and V2 just sees everything as arguments.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0de7117492fb64c4f2b4f5ee7482813d57b57d40/> `handshake::Ref::Symbolic` now has a `tag` field.
   This allows symbolic refs to be parsed which are in fact pointing
   to an annotated tag as in-between object.

## 0.33.2 (2023-06-10)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c8e8b9fc55486215bda4c380d3c84a6c6ae5f602/> support `capabilities^{}` syntax to announce caps in empty repos under V1
   This is supposed to work for existing code, but doesn't in our case as we really
   want to associate a branch. In this case, we can ignore the ref as it's a null
   hash anyway.

## 0.33.1 (2023-06-07)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-88670c2ff995e4478f4a40b2733c6c8ca811fa15/> assure we don't stop early on NAK if READY was sent to handle V1 specialty.
   Seeing READY means a pack will follow, which is exactly the kind of knowledge we want.
   Thus we now either listen to the client OR to what the server says.
   
   Note that this remedy relies on `multi-ack-detailed`, which some very old servers might
   not support. For those we would be out-of-luck, but that seems acceptable.

## 0.33.0 (2023-06-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-877aa2921d8491d301945f86d5a69382e40fb081/> Add `fetch::Arguments::is_stateless()` to aid proper use of arguments.
   When arguments are used, haves are reset every round in stateless protocols, while
   everything else is repeated. However, this also means that previously confirmed common
   commits aren't repeated unless this is specifically implemented by the user of `Arguments`.
   
   That caller can now easily determine if negotiations have to be compensated for.
   
   Please note that `Arguments` explicitly doesn't implement repeating of all prior arguments, which
   would also repeat a lot of *in-vain* haves.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c5dc7b4c43f07c04cdfb218de03e6725ff3fdb64/> `include-tag` is now properly handled in V1 fetch arguments
   Previously it would be added like it's V2 arguments, which makes using it
   in V1 impossible.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6a3c02131c9ebca911be5f751e5a6c67fbdbf609/> make V1 stateless negotations work.
   This is done by working around another V1 negotiation oddity
   by exploiting client-side knowledge. For very old servers, we probably
   wouldn't be able to do multi-rounds without dead-locking, but with
   recent-enough (probably 10 years or so) old git servers all should
   work fine.
   
   All this to not actually have to implement the V1 strangeness, allowing
   our code to work smoothly with all permutations of stateless/stateful connections
   and V1/V2 interactions, with a single high-level implementation essentially.

## 0.31.0 (2023-04-26)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

   The type-system allows this even though when getting credentials this should never happen and won't
   in the default implementation. However, users can of course return nothing and provide no error which
   is when we have to create one, instead of panicking.

## 0.26.4 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

## 0.26.3 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-da68bfb8104ecf58e73e3f99d87f81c90712a2ca/> fetch::Ref::Symbolic::target is now an option…
   …to represent the possibility that the server may not be able to
   strip its namespace if it is not the currently set namespace.
   
   Note that the object it points to might still be resolvable and
   pointing to another namespace.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-02e37f04d7dfeab7067c8273bcd76408cb1f4852/> Support for `unborn` ls-refs capability if server supports it.
   We can also parse it, adding yet another variant to `fetch::Refs`.
 - <csr-id-32dc1829a5661f66396d109c8d0a8eaae6b1f532/> use `git-credentials` in `git-protocol`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-09070a7c17f39383730c3a2b809eec677f79f386/> move `fetch::refs(…, protocol, …)` to the crate root as `ls_refs(…)`.
   This move also removes the `protocol` parameter as ls-refs is only available
   in V2 and the caller is forced to know that after running a
   `handshake(…)` anyway which yields the actual protocol used by the
   server.
   
   Note that the client can suggest the version to use when connecting,
   which is specific to the transport at hand.
 - <csr-id-35f7b4df164c130fb50fcffcf5de99816c2ca872/> move `fetch::Command` into the crate root.
   This represents much better on how it is actually used, which is for
   validation of any Command invoked through the protocol independenty.
 - <csr-id-a03f8f6cce34618883e8448dd1c31b41c54d9448/> move `fetch::agent|indicate_end_of_interaction` to crate root
   These are generally useful in all interactions, including push.
 - <csr-id-a3bcf82ae50defa4439862943008647d03d09792/> `handshake(…)` is now generalized to support `git-receive-pack` as well.
   Note that `fetch::handshake()` is still present, selecting the correct
   service like before, but most of the `fetch::Ref` parsing is now handled
   by `handshake::Ref` in it's more general location.
   
   There is still `fetch::refs(…)` which just invokes a V2 ls-refs command
   (without that being generalized) as `git-receive-pack` just supports
   V1 at the moment, and making the `fetch::LsRefs` Command more general
   would mean that every command has to be general, at is doesn't matter
   anymore if it's used for Fetch or Push.
   
   As long as git won't support V2 for pushes, which it never might,
   there is no need to introduce this breakage even though it
   should probably be done before going 1.0.
 - <csr-id-d05b0b800a553e1e380801fb141e9aa054a6cbd0/> `fetch::agent()` returns agent string only; `fetch()` takes agent name as parameter.
 - <csr-id-aab278f2a3e07edb6d8109e7ffba003b5d5d7857/> don't auto-insert user agent, instead prepare to insert it later.
 - <csr-id-f957d9a1833af079b01ba6bd6941eb4af6c9e436/> `fetch::agent()` now returns the agent name, `fetch::agent_tuple()` returns specific key-value pair.
   This is in preparation for allowing user-defined agent strings.
 - <csr-id-cd867ade55eaec138029c0cf17fa83e0679ef7fc/> `fetch::Ref::unpack()` returns `Option<oid>`.
   That way the caller has to be aware of the possibility of an unborn
   branch (probably the only unborn branch) on the remote.
 - <csr-id-91f193f73ae37314319f7d055893b95431fd018e/> `fetch::Ref::unpack()` returns `&BStr` instead of `&BString` as ref name.
 - <csr-id-d2c772e28619f7602ab01285b25e79a7040c9aab/> `fetch::Ref::unpack()` now returns the peeled object as well.
 - <csr-id-bab586099a6e21e54932218f7a5c14f8bfc6cabd/> rename `fetch::Ref::path` to `fetch::Ref::full_ref_name`.
   Previously it was inaccurately named and described due to an
   insufficient understanding of the ref database.
 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-e91c301342d44cff35ebe12fba4ec10afb4a1922/> replace `quick-error` with `this-error`
 - <csr-id-12589cc6f08e4d7aabae30bcdadaa0c2b4850229/> adapt to changes in `git-url` and use `BString` to represent URLs.
   They can contain paths, which is why `String` can't repsent a URL
   losslessly.
   
   For HTTP urls these are ultimately UTF-8 strings though.

### Reverted

 - <csr-id-f87b7eb4dc05b73f33ac554b57d50f3eee7f84c1/> `client::fetch_pack()` isn't worth it after all.
   The overhead required to make it work isn't worth the logic we are
   enabling. Instead, it's OK to re-implement custom logic on the consumer
   side based on this one.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-5f2276b63129163096be3cb229864fc589348da8/> don't enforce V2 as protocol, but smoothly downgrade like git does.
   For backward compatibility the shared handshake implementation allows the
   transport to control which protocol versions it wants to support
   to allow optiomizing for one special case, namely to prevent it to
   read all V1 refs on old servers but abort instead, closing the connection
   without delay.
   
   Now we leave this feature for custom transports (who usually come with custom
   servers) and instead support fallbacks to other protocols if the server
   demands it.
 - <csr-id-a8727824a4c38b27d6ad7c73ccaf7a45839c0aa9/> don't pass 'include-tag' as argument by default.
   This flag always has to be added by the caller based on configuration.
 - <csr-id-24000fa7ad4607c23f6a4fb4d84d2c85d96ee01f/> don't post `packfile-uris` capability unless we are able to make use of it.
   Turns out that this option can be rejected by a server that advertises
   it, so definitely needs more work to make it work.
 - <csr-id-806b8c2ef392137f3a6ebd0f28da2a3a07a9f3eb/> Parse refs from bytes, not from String.
   The latter can cause issues around illformed UTF-8 which wouldn't
   bother git either.
   
   This comes at the expense of not parsing line by line anymore, but
   instead reading as fast as possible and parsing afterwards.
   
   Performance wise I think it doesn't matter, but it will cause
   more memory to be used. If this ever becomes a problem,
   for example during pushes where we are stuck with V1, we can consider
   implementing our own streaming appreach that works with packet lines
   instead - they are just not exposed here even though they could.
 - <csr-id-d7f62b441700c6d3526517c8c4f369cb9a72c102/> support keepalive packets.
   Keepalive packets are side-band only empty datalines that should
   just be ignored. This is now happening, allowing longer git
   operations to work as they will send keepalive packets every 5 seconds,
   and previously we would choke on it.
   
   Note that empty datalines are never send otherwise, making it a
   previously unused marker that can safely be skipped.
 - <csr-id-266395e18d7cf754f51355098c84fd1c969fc972/> Link up Io error as source for error chaining; add `Debug` to `client::fetch::Response`
 - <csr-id-c77bd7a01820110154f2c66cd954c1ccfff173c1/> '(null)' symref targets are turned into direct refs instead…
   …because that's what 'git' would do if it would care enough.
   On the client side this means one has to deal with detached heads
   and it's obvious that these are detached. It's not clear anymore
   why this is the case, and probably it's good to hide it as the
   current git behaviour is accidental and may change in future, and
   do so in a way we predict.
   
   There is the possibility that git would abort the entire
   fetch/upload-pack operation, but that's already handled correctly
   by our implementation as well as we understand ERR messages in packet
   lines.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4b8abb0e8a5326662f36b88f04681bdd0eaa8079/> display the underlying permission denied error as source when failng handshake due to authentication.
 - <csr-id-5a50d9599f820237866928df6d24a196a9b86fe3/> `fetch::Arguments::use_include_tag()` allows to signal `include-tag`.
   One can also check for its availability using `fetch::Arguments::can_use_include_tag()`.
   
   Further there was a bugfix that assues V1 capabilities are correctly interpreted to support
   include-tag.
 - <csr-id-1c0a6c0edaca4063129c3b06638629b7af17a64c/> due to more specific errors one can differentiate if remote authentication failed repeatedly.
 - <csr-id-2363bcbd3207d1d16f2f95fbd20a7d7715b92240/> some errors support `is_spurious()` to tell if retrying is possible.
 - <csr-id-68c65a9f8b3927d454164a6f72167b47c0facee5/> expose `futures_lite` for convenience in downstream crates.
 - <csr-id-aed93d22d7a7faf4d60f1f603830c882175cbcb6/> Allow defaulting `fetch::handshake::Outcome`.
   This is useful in conjunction with `std::mem::take()`.
 - <csr-id-0bcb2fd4d5d8692a0e91c70bcbcbff9dff60442f/> `fetch::Arguments::is_empty()` to help decide if arguments should be sent at all.
   Furthermore, the `Debug` trait was added.
 - <csr-id-31a7089f2583832727e2175ada6fb5c30c3beebe/> make some private methods public to give callers more flexibility.
   This allows to implement the fetch-negotiation part oneself and break
   free from constraints of the delegate.
 - <csr-id-744ed03cf6648e258affab62ef39ffad75c65397/> add `client::fetch_pack()` allowing to fetch a pack after a handshake.
 - <csr-id-eaff67c14366f149ccca346acb46af12531a24e6/> `helper::main` to easily create credential helper implementations
 - <csr-id-5ba9e1d20a8d523571a153f9f4e3e1a5285335b5/> provide a function to gracefully shut donw a fetch transport
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-d6b4878d9832a0279e0dd19c1ca520a282289e69/> re-export maybe_async
   That way, API users can also provide dynamically sync or async APIs.
 - <csr-id-d2de51d65f9b4ab895e19cc1b307e42a9bb4bbd8/> add `fetch::refs()` method to invoke `ls-refs` for V2 and parse the result
 - <csr-id-35d17b4ea80be611607faa774d1ce0ee9c5000f2/> factor fetch handshake into `fetch::handshake()` function
 - <csr-id-0826cc92717faceff62df48a6e86fbb7ca6e90f5/> in-manifest and in-lib feature documentation

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### Changed

 - <csr-id-3a38d1bc4910aab98c9c0b4a309be4a449db92fc/> turn `prepare_ls_refs` in `fetch::refs()` into `FnOnce`.

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

## 0.26.2 (2023-01-10)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.26.1 (2023-01-09)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.26.0 (2022-12-30)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4b8abb0e8a5326662f36b88f04681bdd0eaa8079/> display the underlying permission denied error as source when failing handshake due to authentication.

## 0.25.1 (2022-12-22)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.25.0 (2022-12-19)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-5a50d9599f820237866928df6d24a196a9b86fe3/> `fetch::Arguments::use_include_tag()` allows to signal `include-tag`.
   One can also check for its availability using `fetch::Arguments::can_use_include_tag()`.
   
   Further there was a bugfix that assumes V1 capabilities are correctly interpreted to support
   include-tag.
 - <csr-id-1c0a6c0edaca4063129c3b06638629b7af17a64c/> due to more specific errors one can differentiate if remote authentication failed repeatedly.
 - <csr-id-2363bcbd3207d1d16f2f95fbd20a7d7715b92240/> some errors support `is_spurious()` to tell if retrying is possible.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-a8727824a4c38b27d6ad7c73ccaf7a45839c0aa9/> don't pass 'include-tag' as argument by default.
   This flag always has to be added by the caller based on configuration.
 - <csr-id-24000fa7ad4607c23f6a4fb4d84d2c85d96ee01f/> don't post `packfile-uris` capability unless we are able to make use of it.
   Turns out that this option can be rejected by a server that advertises
   it, so definitely needs more work to make it work.
 - <csr-id-806b8c2ef392137f3a6ebd0f28da2a3a07a9f3eb/> Parse refs from bytes, not from String.
   The latter can cause issues around illformed UTF-8 which wouldn't
   bother git either.
   
   This comes at the expense of not parsing line by line anymore, but
   instead reading as fast as possible and parsing afterwards.
   
   Performance wise I think it doesn't matter, but it will cause
   more memory to be used. If this ever becomes a problem,
   for example during pushes where we are stuck with V1, we can consider
   implementing our own streaming approach that works with packet lines
   instead - they are just not exposed here even though they could.
 - <csr-id-5f2276b63129163096be3cb229864fc589348da8/> don't enforce V2 as protocol, but smoothly downgrade like git does.
   For backward compatibility the shared handshake implementation allows the
   transport to control which protocol versions it wants to support
   to allow optimizing for one special case, namely to prevent it to
   read all V1 refs on old servers but abort instead, closing the connection
   without delay.
   
   Now we leave this feature for custom transports (who usually come with custom
   servers) and instead support fallbacks to other protocols if the server
   demands it.

## 0.24.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.23.0 (2022-11-17)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-68c65a9f8b3927d454164a6f72167b47c0facee5/> expose `futures_lite` for convenience in downstream crates.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-09070a7c17f39383730c3a2b809eec677f79f386/> move `fetch::refs(…, protocol, …)` to the crate root as `ls_refs(…)`.
   This move also removes the `protocol` parameter as ls-refs is only available
   in V2 and the caller is forced to know that after running a
   `handshake(…)` anyway which yields the actual protocol used by the
   server.
   
   Note that the client can suggest the version to use when connecting,
   which is specific to the transport at hand.
 - <csr-id-35f7b4df164c130fb50fcffcf5de99816c2ca872/> move `fetch::Command` into the crate root.
   This represents much better on how it is actually used, which is for
   validation of any Command invoked through the protocol independently.
 - <csr-id-a03f8f6cce34618883e8448dd1c31b41c54d9448/> move `fetch::agent|indicate_end_of_interaction` to crate root
   These are generally useful in all interactions, including push.
 - <csr-id-a3bcf82ae50defa4439862943008647d03d09792/> `handshake(…)` is now generalized to support `git-receive-pack` as well.
   Note that `fetch::handshake()` is still present, selecting the correct
   service like before, but most of the `fetch::Ref` parsing is now handled
   by `handshake::Ref` in it's more general location.
   
   There is still `fetch::refs(…)` which just invokes a V2 ls-refs command
   (without that being generalized) as `git-receive-pack` just supports
   V1 at the moment, and making the `fetch::LsRefs` Command more general
   would mean that every command has to be general, at is doesn't matter
   anymore if it's used for Fetch or Push.
   
   As long as git won't support V2 for pushes, which it never might,
   there is no need to introduce this breakage even though it
   should probably be done before going 1.0.
 - <csr-id-d05b0b800a553e1e380801fb141e9aa054a6cbd0/> `fetch::agent()` returns agent string only; `fetch()` takes agent name as parameter.
 - <csr-id-aab278f2a3e07edb6d8109e7ffba003b5d5d7857/> don't auto-insert user agent, instead prepare to insert it later.
 - <csr-id-f957d9a1833af079b01ba6bd6941eb4af6c9e436/> `fetch::agent()` now returns the agent name, `fetch::agent_tuple()` returns specific key-value pair.
   This is in preparation for allowing user-defined agent strings.

## 0.22.0 (2022-11-06)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-cd867ade55eaec138029c0cf17fa83e0679ef7fc/> `fetch::Ref::unpack()` returns `Option<oid>`.
   That way the caller has to be aware of the possibility of an unborn
   branch (probably the only unborn branch) on the remote.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-02e37f04d7dfeab7067c8273bcd76408cb1f4852/> Support for `unborn` ls-refs capability if server supports it.
   We can also parse it, adding yet another variant to `fetch::Refs`.

## 0.21.0 (2022-10-10)

### Changed

 - <csr-id-3a38d1bc4910aab98c9c0b4a309be4a449db92fc/> turn `prepare_ls_refs` in `fetch::refs()` into `FnOnce`.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-aed93d22d7a7faf4d60f1f603830c882175cbcb6/> Allow defaulting `fetch::handshake::Outcome`.
   This is useful in conjunction with `std::mem::take()`.
 - <csr-id-0bcb2fd4d5d8692a0e91c70bcbcbff9dff60442f/> `fetch::Arguments::is_empty()` to help decide if arguments should be sent at all.
   Furthermore, the `Debug` trait was added.
 - <csr-id-31a7089f2583832727e2175ada6fb5c30c3beebe/> make some private methods public to give callers more flexibility.
   This allows to implement the fetch-negotiation part oneself and break
   free from constraints of the delegate.
 - <csr-id-744ed03cf6648e258affab62ef39ffad75c65397/> add `client::fetch_pack()` allowing to fetch a pack after a handshake.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d7f62b441700c6d3526517c8c4f369cb9a72c102/> support keepalive packets.
   Keepalive packets are side-band only empty datalines that should
   just be ignored. This is now happening, allowing longer git
   operations to work as they will send keepalive packets every 5 seconds,
   and previously we would choke on it.
   
   Note that empty datalines are never send otherwise, making it a
   previously unused marker that can safely be skipped.
 - <csr-id-266395e18d7cf754f51355098c84fd1c969fc972/> Link up Io error as source for error chaining; add `Debug` to `client::fetch::Response`

### Reverted

 - <csr-id-f87b7eb4dc05b73f33ac554b57d50f3eee7f84c1/> `client::fetch_pack()` isn't worth it after all.
   The overhead required to make it work isn't worth the logic we are
   enabling. Instead, it's OK to re-implement custom logic on the consumer
   side based on this one.

## 0.20.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-91f193f73ae37314319f7d055893b95431fd018e/> `fetch::Ref::unpack()` returns `&BStr` instead of `&BString` as ref name.
 - <csr-id-d2c772e28619f7602ab01285b25e79a7040c9aab/> `fetch::Ref::unpack()` now returns the peeled object as well.
 - <csr-id-bab586099a6e21e54932218f7a5c14f8bfc6cabd/> rename `fetch::Ref::path` to `fetch::Ref::full_ref_name`.
   Previously it was inaccurately named and described due to an
   insufficient understanding of the ref database.
 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e91c301342d44cff35ebe12fba4ec10afb4a1922/> replace `quick-error` with `this-error`
 - <csr-id-12589cc6f08e4d7aabae30bcdadaa0c2b4850229/> adapt to changes in `gix-url` and use `BString` to represent URLs.
   They can contain paths, which is why `String` can't represent a URL
   losslessly.
   
   For HTTP urls these are ultimately UTF-8 strings though.

<csr-id-c77bd7a01820110154f2c66cd954c1ccfff173c1/>

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c77bd7a01820110154f2c66cd954c1ccfff173c1/> '(null)' symref targets are turned into direct refs instead
   
   because that's what 'git' would do if it would care enough.
   On the client side this means one has to deal with detached heads
   and it's obvious that these are detached. It's not clear anymore
   why this is the case, and probably it's good to hide it as the
   current git behaviour is accidental and may change in future, and
   do so in a way we predict.
   
   There is the possibility that git would abort the entire
   fetch/upload-pack operation, but that's already handled correctly
   by our implementation as well as we understand ERR messages in packet
   lines.
