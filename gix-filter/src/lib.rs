//! A library for implementing everything needed to deal with git filter pipelines.
//!
//! Generally, multiple filters are applied in a row forming a pipeline, with each filter being a stage in that pipeline.
//! This pipeline is pre-determined with each stage being configurable.
//!
//! The transformation on an input buffer goes in two ways: either a filter is applied, or its effects are undone. Differentiating
//! between these states is important to avoid comparing unfiltered buffers with filtered ones, for example.
//!
//! This crate implements the building blocks in terms of applying and undoing filters, along with logic to decide whether
//! or not to apply such a filter.
