# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.7.0 (2023-12-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-0f03a08e9e07979c476a7def0c045fcdfddcbb7c/> Allow obtaining mutable pipeline buffers.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c752f67090265dac78e43c132de1d6cced61be9c/> Use `gix-objet::Find` error type.
 - <csr-id-42d45906d67c6930cb0abb567e59834ac9ae1478/> cleanup trailing newlines when handling delayed files.
   Otherwise we would have seen newlines in filepaths, which then would
   not match any file in the list of expected paths.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c74c7feea9b4404c3e0f403e22cf64561c8d12ee/> simplify `Pipeline::new()` by reomving the metadata collection.
   It's required, but in practice has no effect as it's initialized at
   just the right time anyway, which is when it does matter.
   
   Also, re-export `gix_attributes as attributes` to allow using the types
   it mentions in the public API.
 - <csr-id-c3edef1c0c49accbb037bdf086dade3ed0e5e507/> make it possible to trace incoming and outgoing packetlines.
   Due to the way this is (and has to be) setup, unfortunately one
   has to integrate that with two crates, instead of just one.
   
   This changes touches multiple crates, most of which receive a single
   boolean as last argument to indicate whether the tracing should
   happen in the first place.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-969ff0f6091196134307554a54e5cf82734d9252/> pass crucial context to help spawning filter processes by adding `context` to `Pipeline::new()`.
   Otherwise, they might now know which repository to apply to,
   leading to errors.

## 0.6.0 (2023-10-12)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-b5b50f8fdb781b7c9a2ff5c8b462940e5098a94d/> hanging `Read` implementation of `pipeline::convert::ToGitOutcome`.
   This codepath was never tested and its function more subtle than one could have known.
   Also fix incorrect configuration handling which could lead to binary files with `text=auto`
   to be identified as text, which would then require conversion.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-260c78191e88d2e2c744d85e6f75e7941c24ef43/> don't provide path to object-retrieval callback of `Pipeline::convert::to_git::IndexObjectFn()`.
   It implies that one has to be ready to fetch any kind of path from the index, even though it's always the path to
   the file that is currently converted.
   
   Also fix a bug that could cause it to return input as unchanged even though it was read into a buffer already.

## 0.4.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-96a07e08e6090222cf398b46aa8d46b56f81f14d/> Use `Vec::resize()` instead of set_len()
   Otherwise it's possible for uninitialized memory to be used as if it was initialized,
   which can lead to strange behaviour.
   
   As the buffer is re-used, it's not actually zeroing that much memory either.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.1.0 (2023-07-19)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-29a64c289946301d5e502ee956f3606280409faf/> make it possible to use filter pipeline with streaming for checkouts.
   This is done by providing a `gix_filter::Pipeline` to `checkout::Options` to control
   how filters are applied.
 - <csr-id-94df6e0e56c0c94e15da89dd9716bcdea5cd4380/> a complete, streaming compatible, `git` filter pipeline.
   It's configuring itself based on each input path and supports streaming.
   
   Some name changes where also performed while at it.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-35415db5d82b82d3908709b6db177bb8d7c3542c/> improve conversion API of `Pipeline::convert_to_git(index_object)` to be more consistent and practical.
   `index_object` now receives the path to the entry as first argument, notably in a data-type that is fitting for
   the purpose.
   Additionally, implement `Clone` for `Pipeline`.
   We also make sure that the input stream is turned into a buffer in case there is no driver, previously filtering
   had nothing to work with if there was no driver.

## 0.0.0 (2023-07-01)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

An empty crate without any content to reserve the name for the gitoxide project.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-198ce27e05fd07d4e511dff1ac50c3f4ed163cdf/> API support for receiving delayed entries
 - <csr-id-5670bbba73c7d48ba6220c2e3773633c234fb21c/> Ability to steer long running filter processes.
 - <csr-id-c538c6eba466f22a3000a76a0d37902ac5256e7a/> ability to run define and run simple filters.
   Simple filters run in real-time and are piped their content to stdin
   while we read it from stdout.
 - <csr-id-d1fed3e9907d0a9e3fe45dbfe2ff27bd10b3e1f4/> `worktree::encode_to_worktree()` to turn UTf-8 into the worktree encoding.
 - <csr-id-1b8f2b7f51e7d17b9b0839f42b75781ae6f940ec/> `worktree::encode_to_git()` to turn worktree encoding to UTF-8.
 - <csr-id-1517cbc42c43b253046b7359c79731771fd7b941/> add `eol::convert_to_worktree()`.
   It's the inverse of `eol::convert_to_git()` to re-add CRLF where there were LF only.
 - <csr-id-e45fec9663f87b7ba4162a9517677f6278c20a98/> Add `eol::convert_to_git()`.
   This function supports all the logic that git executes to determine
   if a converion should actually be done.
 - <csr-id-b79ffeb9ed584c47f2609eea261e1ada557a744c/> `eol::Stats::from_bytes()` to obtain stats about a buffer.
   It can help to determine if it is binary and if line conversions should be performed at all.
 - <csr-id-306c8eabcffe80da1d627283c4b188a1b979f692/> add `ident::apply()` to substitute `$Id$` with `$Id: <hex>$`
 - <csr-id-496445ca97687a38ecb80e871a1cbdc7ecd6b313/> `ident::undo()` to replace `$Id: XXX$` with `$Id$`

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere
