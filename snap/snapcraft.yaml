summary: gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust
description: |
    gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust for developing future-proof applications 
    which strive for correctness and performance while providing a pleasant and unsurprising 
    developer experience.
    gitoxide provides the gix and ein binaries for use on the command-line to allow experimentation
    with key features like fetch and clone, and to validate the usability and control of the API
    offered by the gix crate.
    gitoxide aspires to be a production-grade server implementation and the ein binary aspires to
    become the default way to interact with git repositories. 
    
    To run from your terminal, type: gix
