//! Read, verify, and traverse git commit graphs.
//!
//! A [commit graph][Graph] is an index of commits in the git commit history.
//! The [Graph] stores commit data in a way that accelerates lookups considerably compared to
//! traversing the git history by usual means.
//!
//! As generating the full commit graph from scratch can take some time, git may write new commits
//! to separate [files][File] instead of overwriting the original file.
//! Eventually, git will merge these files together as the number of files grows.
//! ## Feature Flags
