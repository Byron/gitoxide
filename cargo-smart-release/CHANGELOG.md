## v0.5.2 (2021-10-19)

Releases will be more atomic and it will try hard to complete all pending operations even in the light
of failure. Now GitHub releases will be created right after a publish succeeded, and tags will be pushed
for all successful publishes.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-db3cb11c466fff57f3f272d7269dc95a636e1c1f/> Add `-d` short flag for `--allow-dirty` in `changelog`

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8c3ca9cf58c44af627fc9b3c4138891635b1c554/> Push all available tags even if an error occurred.
   
   That way, tags don't remain unpushed despite having been created
   successfully, just because one crate later in the publishing
   process fails.
 - <csr-id-b769c47079a16042ef592a0199cb2d0f6afeeb5e/> Create GitHub release right after publishing succeeds.
   
   This is more atomic and prevents loosing all github releases if one
   publish fails later on.
 - <csr-id-ae8570050a313457bb2fd6659e31f34fd29bc325/> `src/` dir of root packages is only used if there is multiple workspace members.
   
   Otherwise one part of the dependency resolver might have concluded that there are changes, while another part would not have.
   The outcome would have been the same, but the messaging around it would have been different unnecessarily.

## v0.5.1 (2021-10-19)

This release contains an important bugfix which may have caused panics when the root-package didn't have changes.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-ed8abfdac40f5c8b17981b8a990572f6f07c8862/> `changelog` subcommand fails if there is nothing to do

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ce68733379a8ab4644c849ba1571bc7063962c64/> Fix panic due to unexpected internal state.
   
   When there was no change in the src/ directory of the top-level crate,
   the dependency resolution would not be able to auto-bump the version
   as no change occurred, but another part would usually detect a change
   as it wasn't confined to the top-level src/ directory.
   
   This could lead to a panic as an invariant wasn't upheld.
   
   This was fixed by letting both parts agree to use the src/ directory
   to determine changes of the top-level directory, and by making panics
   impossible while improving the messaging around this state should it
   still occur. The latter is rough, probably rare, but usable.
 - <csr-id-6ee4f5d20c832a54ca5d841773d93f0927a16f25/> Correct the reporting of manifest changes.
   
   Previously even unchanged crates would trigger workspace crates
   to be recorded for manifest changes.
   
   Now only crates that are to receive manifest changes will be triggering
   this.

## v0.5.0 (2021-10-19)

<csr-id-07372dd045de88f283d35d8f3dcc4c079dce88e9/>

A release with breaking changes as the dependency engine was reworked to handle even more cases
and make future improvements easier.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6d4edfa3b2d2c6700e0956716a575831b940cb50/> Respect `publish=false` in cargo manifest
 - <csr-id-7648bf3c7554352bec8e1355f9b593d891b2b17f/> Perform safety bumps without forcing a publish.
   
   This is what's required to assure that future publishes of such
   transitively dependent crates won't cause downstream breakage the next time the tool is run.
 - <csr-id-b806a9c982da1e5ff42c268e430c67363f3a7918/> Inform about safety bumps more explicitly,
   and generally greatly improve the way the course of action is described.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-501c1d102c0e5e4635120bb1aa857e97a2b537b4/> Dependency resolution.
   
   Previously the ordering of crates for release might not have been
   correct due to this issue that is now fixed.
   
   We need depth-first traversals and previously it would extend skipped
   dependencies, effectively putting them into their own ordering.
   
   Previously it would restore that ordering, but not anymore, causing
   this bug that was entirely unnecessary.
 - <csr-id-5e98e5559707cf308e2cd64494fe73a99f9e9c8e/> `--no-changelog` during smart-release is now actually working
   
   Previously the flag had no effect and changelogs would always be
   generated, possibly stopping the release as at least one of them
   needed manual work.
 - <csr-id-dfc588b25ede3faa578eb8e131e73c857117a6df/> Pin version of clap to beta 5.
   
   This assures we don't get broken automatically in future.
   Previously that wasn't possible as the dependency of `clap`,
   `clap-derive` was also using a beta verion and wasn't constrained,
   hence it would be updated and cause breaking changes with pinned
   versions of consumers of `clap`.

### Changed (BREAKING)

<csr-id-2f87196217a6e685dc447b4af091842926aed6d0/>

 - <csr-id-59302ae24db791988c22322c2c1ad72e2918f89a/> `changelog` subcommand inverts `--dependencies` to `--no-dependencies`
 - Remove `--no-multi-crate-release` support entirely
  
   As the default is to do multi-crate releases and now having to deal
   with single-create releases reduces maintenance burden.

   The solution to this problem is to not specify version constraints in
   dev-dependencies to workspace crates.

   We also don't check for this anymore, which might be re-added
   at some point if there is demand.This makes dependency resolution similar to cargo smart-release by default and is less surprising.

This major release adds **changelog** support to automatically generate scaffolding to be filled in by hand. The feature is driven by
[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) messages which are used sparingly to mark important changes only.
Furthermore, it will deduce the require version bump, i.e. patch, minor or major, automatically by looking at the commit history
and interpreting _'conventional commit'_ messages. This means that from time to time one would sprinkle in a specifically formatted
commit message to leave enough information to determine the correct release version and create changelog scaffolding.

If you have 10 minutes, the following video gives the whirlwind tour through the new features (_and note that all issues discovered there
have been fixed :)_).

If you have 30 minutes, there is also [a long version of the video](https://youtu.be/a4CzzxJ7ecE).

And there is another one showing `cargo smart-release` releasing `gitoxide 0.9.0`, along with some explanation on how it works.

### Changelog Support in `cargo smart-release`

When using `cargo smart-release` in dry-run mode (_default_), additional information regarding changelog will be printed.
This informs you a release would be attempted, or if manual adjustments to the changelogs would be required, for example as
they are fully generated with statistical information only.

If there is no issue with the initial changelogs, passing the `--execute` flag will write the changelogs after
providing them to you for preview (using `bat`) for a last chance to abort the operation. Otherwise the publishing
will proceed, which includes the creation of tag objects containing the relevant section of the changelog, along with
a GitHub release which is annotated with the same section (_only if the repository is hosted on GitHub_).

If there are issues to be corrected, there will be suggestions to run `cargo changelog --write --only <crate-name>`
one by one, or the release operation will have left a single commit with all changelogs written out.
In any case, it's recommended to re-write the changelog after editing to assure it is indeed stable and won't change each time
the generator is run.

For more information, run `cargo smart-release -h`.

### The `cargo changelog` Sub-Command

This new sub-command sports the same dependency resolution as `smart-release` itself, operates in dry-run mode by default
to preview changelogs that would be written. Use the `--write` flag to actually write changes to disk.

It's primary use is to conveniently generate changelogs from time to time to add the final polish by hand before
actually releasing them along with the crate with `smart-release`.

For more information, run `cargo changelog -h`.

### Other BREAKING Changes

- renamed `--skip-*` flags to `--no-*` for consistency
- rename `--skip-dependencies` to `--no-dependencies` to be more inline with existing terminology of other flags.
- rename short name for `--execute` to `-e` from `-n` for consistency

### Other Changes

 - <csr-id-e668bf23ddba9a676a885f1f401d2d2885784eef/> `--no-dependencies` now has `--only` as alias

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-11eebdcc572a72b2e66a9db3cae0a01f12a81619/> Previously it might have been possible to see that it won't use a 'new' crate version as it's already in the manifest, _even_ if these are the same. This is now fixed.
