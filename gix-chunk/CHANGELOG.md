## 0.4.2 (2023-06-06)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

## 0.4.1 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-9d9f2ee55202788910cd955cdcc08196d18f2cf5/> Use `[u8;4]` as chunk id
   This allows to remove the additional string to describe the ids, which
   are usually ascii anyway.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-11b0f4afc993fe1eb1316839baaa15187483d420/> `file::Index::chunks` is not public anymore
   The internal state is validated, and to assure that it can't be publicly
   accessible.
 - <csr-id-9328015c653cae582882c346965b51d7cf6b9d08/> rename `into_usize_range()` to `range::into_usize()`
 - <csr-id-dda26a4ddd7cc195c10b79a7f428d6298285197b/> rename `Kind` to `Id`
   This is more in line with gits terminology and feels quite natural to
   use as well.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-389fea2addc94801e73a521b2ac9a8529e4fbb3d/> Facilities to write chunk files
   This includes utilities to plan chunks for writing the table of
   contents, and to get a hand when actually writing the chunks themselves
   while assuring they are written into the correct spot.
 - <csr-id-373a85003e0b293666283ef742762b13e1211fc5/> add `file::Index::size_for_entries()` const fn
   This is useful for min-size checks of files that are to be loaded.
 - <csr-id-e14096e0c19689a1e2480b484537b2a0ffbfc3b9/> add `file::Index::usize_offset_by_id()` and `range::into_usize_or_panic()`
 - <csr-id-d0fab1e7f083088f607365ceec056e6e521cbdcc/> new file::Index::highest_offset() method
   With it it's simpler to figure out from where to read trailing
   checksums.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

## 0.4.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.3.2 (2022-09-20)

Maintenance release without observable changes.

## 0.3.1 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

## 0.3.0 (2022-01-23)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-389fea2addc94801e73a521b2ac9a8529e4fbb3d/> Facilities to write chunk files
   This includes utilities to plan chunks for writing the table of
   contents, and to get a hand when actually writing the chunks themselves
   while assuring they are written into the correct spot.
 - <csr-id-373a85003e0b293666283ef742762b13e1211fc5/> add `file::Index::size_for_entries()` const fn
   This is useful for min-size checks of files that are to be loaded.
 - <csr-id-e14096e0c19689a1e2480b484537b2a0ffbfc3b9/> add `file::Index::usize_offset_by_id()` and `range::into_usize_or_panic()`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-11b0f4afc993fe1eb1316839baaa15187483d420/> `file::Index::chunks` is not public anymore
   The internal state is validated, and to assure that it can't be publicly
   accessible.
 - <csr-id-9328015c653cae582882c346965b51d7cf6b9d08/> rename `into_usize_range()` to `range::into_usize()`
 - <csr-id-dda26a4ddd7cc195c10b79a7f428d6298285197b/> rename `Kind` to `Id`
   This is more in line with gits terminology and feels quite natural to
   use as well.

## 0.2.0 (2021-12-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d0fab1e7f083088f607365ceec056e6e521cbdcc/> new `file::Index::highest_offset()` method
   With it it's simpler to figure out from where to read trailing
   checksums.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9d9f2ee55202788910cd955cdcc08196d18f2cf5/> Use `[u8;4]` as chunk id
   This allows to remove the additional string to describe the ids, which
   are usually ascii anyway.

## 0.1.0 (2021-12-20)

Initial release with enough functionality to handle multi-pack indices and commitgraph files.
