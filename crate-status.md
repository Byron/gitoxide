### gitoxide

**gix** is a command-line interface (*CLI*) to access git repositories in various ways best described as low-level
for use by experts or those validating functionality in real-world scenarios. Performance and efficiency are staples
of the implementation.

**ein** is reserved for one-off tools that are useful to many, and will one day implement a truly unique workflow
with the potential to become the preferred way to interact with git repositories.

Please note that all functionality comes from the `gitoxide-core` library, which mirrors these capabilities
and itself relies on all `gix-*` crates. It's not meant for consumption, for application development, please use `gix`.

* **the `ein` program** - convenient and for humans
    * [x] **init** - initialize a new non-bare repository with a `main` branch
    * [ ] **clone** - initialize a local copy of a remote repository
    * **tools**
        * [x] **organize** - find all git repositories and place them in directories according to their remote paths
        * [x] **find** - find all git repositories in a given directory - useful for tools like [skim][skim]
        * [x] **estimate-hours** - estimate the time invested into a repository by evaluating commit dates.
            * Based on the [git-hours] algorithm.
            * See the [discussion][git-hours-discussion] for some performance data.
* **the `gix` program** _(plumbing)_ - lower level commands for use in automation
    * **progress** - provide an overview of what works and what doesn't from the perspective of the git configuration.
      This is likely to change a lot over time depending on actual needs, but maybe useful for you to see
      if particular git-configuration is picked up and where it deviates.
    * **config** - list the complete git configuration in human-readable form and optionally filter sections by name.
    * **exclude**
        * [x] **query** - check if path specs are excluded via gits exclusion rules like `.gitignore`.
    * **verify** - validate a whole repository, for now only the object database.
    * **commit**
        * [x] **describe** - identify a commit by its closest tag in its past

    * **revision**
        * [x] **list** - list plain revision hashes from a starting point, similar to a very simple version of `git rev-list`.

        * [x] **resolve** - show which objects a revspec resolves to, similar to `git rev-parse` but faster and with much better error handling
        * [x] **previous-branches** - list all previously checked out branches, powered by the ref-log.

        * [x] **refs** - list all references available on the remote based on the current remote configuration.
        * [x] **ref-map** - show how remote references relate to their local tracking branches as mapped by refspecs.
    * [x] **fetch** - fetch the current remote or the given one, optionally just as dry-run.
    * **clone**
        * [x] initialize a new **bare** repository and fetch all objects.
        * [x] initialize a new repository, fetch all objects and checkout the main worktree.
    * **credential**

            * [x] [receive](https://asciinema.org/a/359321) - receive a whole pack produced by **pack-send** or _git-upload-pack_, useful for `clone` like operations.
            * [x] **create** - create a pack from given objects or tips of the commit graph.
            * [ ] **send** - create a pack and send it using the pack protocol to stdout, similar to 'git-upload-pack',

### gix-tix

A re-implementation of a minimal `tig` like UI that aims to be fast and to the point.

### gix-lfs

Definitely optimize for performance and see how we fare compared to [oxen](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release/blob/main/Performance.md).
Right now, `git lfs` is 40x slower, due to sequential uploads and lack of fast compression. It seems this can be greatly improved to get
close to 6min for 200k images (1.4GB). GitHub seems to cap upload speeds to 100kb/s, one major reason it's so slow, and it can only do 
it sequentially as `git-lfs` doesn't use the new `filter-process` protocol which would allow parallelization.
Oxen uses the XXH3 (30gb/s) which greatly outperforms SHA1 - however, it doesn't look like the hash is necessarily the bottleneck in typical benchmarks.
