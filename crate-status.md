### git-bundle
* [ ] create a bundle from an archive
   * [ ] respect `export-ignore` and `export-subst`
* [ ] extract a branch from a bundle into a repository
* [ ] API documentation
    * [ ] Some examples

### git-validate
* [x] validate ref names
* [x] [validate][tagname-validation] tag names

### git-ref
* [ ] Prepare code for arrival of longer hashes like Sha256. It's part of the [V2 proposal][reftable-v2] but should work for loose refs as well.
* **Stores**
  * [ ] disable transactions during [quarantine]
  * [x] namespaces
    * a server-side feature to transparently isolate refs in a single shared repository, allowing all forks to live in the same condensed repository.
  * **loose file**
    * [x] ref validation
    * [x] find single ref by name
    * [ ] special handling of `FETCH_HEAD` and `MERGE_HEAD`
    * [x] iterate refs with optional prefix
    * **worktree support**
        * [x] support multiple bases and classify refs
        * [x] support for ref iteration merging common and private refs seamlessly.
        * [x] avoid packing refs which are worktree private
    * ~~symbolic ref support, using symbolic links~~
        * This is a legacy feature which is not in use anymore.
    * **transactions** 
      * [x] delete, create or update single ref or multiple refs while handling the _reflog_
      * [x] set any valid ref value (not just object ids)
      * [x] reflog changes can be entirely disabled (i.e. for bare repos)
      * [ ] rename or copy references
      * [x] transparent handling of packed-refs during deletion
      * [x] writing loose refs into packed-refs and optionally delete them
      * [ ] initial transaction optimization (a faster way to create clones with a lot of refs)
    * **log**
      * [x] forward iteration
      * [x] backward iteration
      * [ ] expire
    * **ref**
      * [x] peel to id
    * **packed**
      * [x] find single ref by name
      * [x] iterate refs with optional prefix
      * [x] handle unsorted packed refs and those without a header
  * [ ] **[reftable][reftable-spec]**, 
    * see [here for a Go/C implementation][reftable-impl]
* [x] API documentation
    * [ ] Some examples

### git-features
* **io-pipe** feature toggle
    * a unix like pipeline for bytes
* **parallel** feature toggle
    * _When on…_
        * `in_parallel`
        * `join`
    * _When off all functions execute serially_
* **fast-sha1**
    * provides a faster SHA1 implementation using CPU intrinsics
* [x] API documentation

### git-tui
* _a terminal user interface seeking to replace and improve on `tig`_
* Can display complex history in novel ways to make them graspable. Maybe [this post] can be an inspiration.
 
### git-tix

A re-implementation of a minimal `tig` like UI that aims to be fast and to the point.
