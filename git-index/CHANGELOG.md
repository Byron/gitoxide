## 0.3.0 (2022-05-18)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-8ab219ac47ca67f2478b8715d7820fd6171c0db2/> `State::path_backing()`.
   That way it's possible to call certain methods that take a separate
   path buffer.
 - <csr-id-645ed50dc2ae5ded2df0c09daf4fe366b90cf47e/> support for separating lifetimes of entries and path-backing
   This way it should be possible to access paths immutably even while
   entries are available mutably, assuming we stagger accesses to put
   mutation of entries last.
