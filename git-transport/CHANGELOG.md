## v0.12.0 (2021-10-15)

### Dependency Upgrade (BREAKING)

* `git-traverse` saw a breaking change moving to v0.9, which triggered this crate to signal a breaking change, too.

### Improvements

* `git-packetline` is now publicly re-exported as `packetline`.
  
  This helps to avoid additional dependencies which in turn may have breaking
  changes. Re-using `packetline` assures it's usable.
