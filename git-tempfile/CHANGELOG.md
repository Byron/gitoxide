## 1.0.6 (2022-02-07)

<csr-id-25209454d3f7e27e12e8ddca92e43b1ff01d58aa/>

Fixes a potential deadlock in in an interrupt handler attempting to cleanup tempfiles.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-25209454d3f7e27e12e8ddca92e43b1ff01d58aa/> upgrade dashmap to 5.1.0 (with security fix)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-81ed5f5e7a3634f0fab681ca59e40099f0118f75/> Assure interrupt based tempfile cleanup can't deadlock.
   
   We do this by using the `try_entry()` API provided by the most recent
   dashmap, at the cost of potentially trying to access a lot of indices
   that don't exist in the map anymore. The cost of this are expected
   to be low though especially since interrupts are the uncommmon case.
   
   A side-effect of this is that tempfiles that are currently being
   removed for writing to them, for example, won't be cleaned up.
   
   It will be up to the code running after the interrupt, if the case
   at all, to deal with the tempfile, which is what it does anyway.
