## 0.35.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-ef54aab9e5521add4154ee8d902d62612a9d8d4a/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-ef54aab9e5521add4154ee8d902d62612a9d8d4a/> switch `nom` to `winnow` in remaining uses in `gix-object`, `gix-ref`, and `gix-actor` for ~20% more performance.
   It's likely that over time, these parsers will get even faster due to improvements to `winnow`.
   Thanks, Ed Page, for single-handedly performing this transition.

## 0.28.0 (2023-04-26)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-3e93141b48ac3e0298c3165e7de0043187e373b9/> speed up finding references by avoiding double-lookup.
   Previously it would try to find `<root>/HEAD` twice due to a logic issue.
 - <csr-id-0c79bdf47ff18553edd330de9a82895393a55c54/> avoid unnecessary check for `remotes/HEAD` if we are looking for `HEAD`.
   This is because we already looked for that in the previous loop, and `HEAD/HEAD` makes no sense
   as this case is made for things like `origin` as partial name.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.
 - <csr-id-b645d28f9641c6b4022e1e37ad9fe528922ec747/> remove types that are now available in `gix-os`

## 0.27.2 (2023-03-28)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-3d6832cb0ea5dc4b3d798fd4ff86602df8d54407/> uncategorized refs should not be per-worktree
   When creating a new ref from using a Repository instantiated from a linked
   worktree, if the ref did not fit one of the well-known categories, it would be
   incorrectly stored as a per-worktree reference instead of a shared reference.
   
   For example, the reference "refs/stacks/linked" does not fit any of the well
   known categories. According to git-worktree(1), this ref should be shared
   across all worktrees; i.e. located at $GIT_COMMON_DIR/refs/stacks/linked and
   *not* in $GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/linked/refs/stacks/linked.
   
   This change tweaks the control flow so that uncategorized refs correctly
   fallback to being relative to commondir while still placing refs that are
   supposed to be per-worktree in the per-worktree location.

## 0.24.1 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/> remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - <csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/> move git_pack::data::Object to git_object::Data, massively alter git_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.
 - <csr-id-0e1875363fea09452789d7a90fc6860a7996d6d3/> `file::Store::base` is now `file::Store::base()` and read-only
   That way, file databases can't be repositioned anymore, it's recommended
   to recreate it if that's desired.

### Other (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c46dec311c76a83dba136be5dba6b70d739c354d/> remove `Target::must_exist()`
   It was a remainder of an old API which since has been replaced
   with a more explicit approach.
 - <csr-id-951c050ecbb70c9de216603e55c7cfbc89a067e3/> Reference::logs() -> Reference::log_iter()
   The latter now returns a standard Platform to iterate over all
   reflog entries from oldest to newest or vice versa.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-0ace957c595c8a38afb7de1462cdc73b617d2a76/> Turn `FullNameRef` into an actual reference type.
   That way `Cow<'_, FullNameRef>` works as expected.

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-725210dc401406fe9450eae9d375b0238d645027/> replace `quick-error` with `thiserror`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e699291097cec346374a30c325848f787ca9d736/> `file::Transaction::prepare()` now takes two `git_lock::acquisition::Fail` instances.
   This allows to configure the file-ref lock failure mode differently from
   the packed-refs lock failure mode, which is exactly what `git` does as
   well defaulting them to 100ms and 1000ms till lock acquisition gives up.
 - <csr-id-0f753e922e313f735ed267f913366771e9de1111/> `Target(Ref)?::try_name()` now returns `Option<&FullNameRef>`.
   That way, the name is actually directly usable in most methods that
   require a validated name as input.
 - <csr-id-3d6299f47f41397c1c72035a86b94d1c263b5b98/> `Transaction::commit(…)` takes `git-actor::SignatureRef` instead of `…::Signature`.
   This makes the API more versatile and corrects a shortcoming that was
   caused by `SignatureRef` previously being unable to serialize itself.
 - <csr-id-f1dbb6bd4534527b6f1f2aba2a562dd4e64cf55d/> remove `FullName::to_ref()` in favor of `•::as_ref()`.
   This became possible now that `FullNameRef` is a proper ref, not just
   ref-like.
 - <csr-id-1611c3ddff6c930deaa4c2440383f5684c029b28/> rename `PartialNameRef` to `PartialNameCow`
   Because this is what it is, which also implies that it's not `Copy`
   anymore which a `Ref` would definitely be.
   
   The reason we need this to be a `Cow` is to support passing ownership.
 - <csr-id-8a92ec9834b6d5aa3057c5509f6c13b6a6cd6e1b/> remove `Store` from public API
   It is unclear if ref-tables, which are the reason for it to exist in
   the first place, will fit into the concept as they might not support
   worktrees. It's entirely unclear how this works.
   
   Maybe there can be a non-worktree version of the store with work-trees
   only being supported by the file based ref database, and ref-tables
   remaining a server-side feature.
 - <csr-id-2becffc85ff6225522fe38482739fb1406ae1060/> rename `file::Store::base()` to `git_dir()`.
   That way it is clearer what it actually is especially in presence
   of the newly added `file::Store::common_dir()` method.
   
   That way, work-trees can eventually be properly supported.
 - <csr-id-7984e19417dff13445f3ef2e15dea96bbd194ce5/> `Target::as_(id|name)` -> `Target::try_(id|name)`
   Conform to naming conventions, whenever something returns an option
   or Result while there is a more direct name that panics, prefix `try_`.
 - <csr-id-dea6659a404bf8b2ad1290549653c776ec04f964/> Required `object_hash` as parameter when instantiating any Store
   This is needed to choose the correct kind of object hash in a couple of
   situations, and future-proofs it for when ref-table arrives.
 - <csr-id-b431fb0fb58b5e2e8aadbbd6aead55c0e42bd67b/> rename `file::Store::packed_buffer()` to `…::open_packed_buffer()`
   This makes much clearer what it actually does, as previously it might
   have been a stored packed buffer as well.
 - <csr-id-80f3d504eeb669f16c5621fac06f6c763ce84e47/> file::Store::from(PathBuf) removed
   At this low level, it's important to be clear about RefLogs and rather
   force the caller to specify the ref-log mode. Technically it depends
   on a few factors, `git-repository` deals with them, but certainly
   shouldn't default to anything without being clear.
 - <csr-id-bfb32aee4e64fd6b1f18c830623cc3fddd059874/> Reference log line access
 - <csr-id-5d498a33236391d8e456f267b1bf6af24de66f11/> file::Store::iter() is now a platform, with `.all()` and `.prefixed(…)` respectively
   This way, it's possible to keep shared ownership of the packed buffer
   while allowing the exact same iterator machinery to work as before.
 - <csr-id-4641499abe00acf6eef0ab6d6bf261b0a27795f8/> file::ReferenceExt::follow(…) now without packed refs parameter
 - <csr-id-55940eb8316d83ac1376c57ba25b3115d62f2012/> `file::ReferenceExt::peel_to_id_in_place(…)` now without packed-refs buffer
   It is instead read from the internally synchronized buffer, shared
   across all instances.
 - <csr-id-15d429bb50602363292453606902bdce5042d9a5/> file::Store::(try_)find(…, packed) was removed
   The packed buffer is now handled internally while loading it on demand.
   When compiled with `git-features/parallel` the `file::Store` remains
   send and sync.
   
   The packed refs buffer is shared across clones and it's recommended
   to clone one `file::Store` instance per thread, each of which can
   use its own namespace.
 - <csr-id-95247322a8191edfa7fac9c5aa72b40239f3aa88/> move `git_ref::file::WriteRefLog` to `git_ref::store::WriteRefLog`

### Other

 - <csr-id-4ed4b2da50557aff540685441f4b5c7d5e582977/> add panicking `Target::id()` and `TargetRef::id()`
 - <csr-id-293bfc0278c5983c0beaec93253fb51f00d81156/> loose reference iteration with non-dir prefixes…
   Previously it was expected for the prefix `Path` to always exist for
   the prefix to be valid. This, however, is not similar to packed
   prefixes, which allow non-dir prefixes as well.
   
   Now we will check if the prefix is actually a directory, and if not
   split it into its parent directory and the filename portion. The latter
   is then used for prefix matching file names within that directory.
 - <csr-id-90e6128727932f917c485f411e623fc6a9c2ad4d/> improve changelog format

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-584b705cee8be3fb68c67dcb8535b981d1efc5f4/> assure symrefs don't get deleted when moving refs to packed-refs.
   Previously it was possible for symbolic refs to be deleted right after
   they have been created or updated as they were included in the set of
   refs that was assumed to be part of packed-refs, which isn't the case
   for symbolic refs.
 - <csr-id-9f848506f5a42abc954612ea375f845e3b23ae5a/> case-insentively conflicting references can be created even on case-insensitie filesystems*.
   The asterisk indicates that this only works if packed-refs are present
   and these references are written straight to packed references without
   ever trying to handle the otherwise conflicting loose reference files.
   
   This is done by leveraging the fact that in presence of packed-refs
   or a pending creation of packed-refs, there is no need to create
   per-file locks as concurrent transactions also have to obtain the
   packed-refs lock and fail (or wait) until it's done.
 - <csr-id-e9853dd640cf4545134aa6e0d093e560af090a2b/> instead of erroring if loose iteration is performed on missing base, correctly yield zero references.
   Previously it reported an error, now it does not and instead performs no
   iteration, which is more helpful to the user of the API I believe as
   they won't randomly fail just because somebody deleted the `refs`
   folder.
 - <csr-id-27386a96ddc022ba75730901f8bb098b9d5ff9d4/> loose ref iteration on a repo with missing 'ref/' fails when creating the iterator.
   Previously, it would fail on first iteration, making it seem like there
   is one reference even though it's just an error stating that the base
   cannot be read.
   
   This is clearly worse than making a metadata check on the filesystem,
   no matter how unlikely the case.
 - <csr-id-6e5c0ae63deed181419232c61896e22404e4c84a/> allow symref updates to receive reflogs if these are new…
   …and well-known on top of that, that means having an exact expectation
   on what should be present.
   
   This allows symrefs to be created with reflog.
 - <csr-id-1d2003519e3b0f745af1524a32f2816475024b31/> always update modification date when packed refs are forcefully reloaded.
   The latter happens right after the file was written, which means we
   definitely have to update our modification date or else the buffer
   will be read again next time somebody asks for an up-to-date version.
   
   The ordering of operations is such that at worst, the buffer is loaded
   again instead of keeping an outdated version of it, which would happen
   if the metadata is read afterwards.
 - <csr-id-42e0487286c1f745837c0ce337ed7c9d86b14516/> support Rust 1.52

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e86e159e00c9b54803abbfa09809707be7ac8aee/> `file::Transaction::rollback()` allows to explicitly roll back a pending change.
   As opposed to dropping the Transaction, this method allows to obtain all
   edits that would have been applied.
 - <csr-id-bbdb4804d8c3bd6a1fb8bea97adce509c90c5ca8/> higher performance for edits which would write the same value.
   Instead of moving them into place, we just drop them, without ever
   writing into them.
 - <csr-id-370ed3dcc393eca7a393ea0150f698a9fc844320/> `transaction::Change::new_value()` to get easy access to new values of references.
   That's more convenient than matching on the enum.
 - <csr-id-658c1257c073507327d9a50c1c89b49d17e9ccbc/> `FullName::try_from(&BString)` for convenience.
   Sometimes when matching one only has a `&BString`, and it's hard to
   convert it to `&BStr` without an extra line of code, it's cumbersome,
   so we workaround by adding another conversion.
 - <csr-id-2d0b63997b276a53b3cf8f09fac51f8e3f044bcd/> Add `Reference::delete()` for simple reference deletion
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-4607a18e24b8270c182663a434b79dff8761db0e/> Add `store::WriteRefLog::Always` to unconditionally write reflogs.
 - <csr-id-f3c609f0af00aa280649975b0705a3cfaad8a0e5/> Allow `Reference` to be serialized/deserialized with `serde`.
 - <csr-id-4a5176a78b64981ce5612b88c7736b7323aa8cdd/> ref iteration for worktrees.
   It merges the iteration result of private worktree refs along with
   all shared common references references.
 - <csr-id-9cccce35e527cdda58e01b03cd335a527418cf14/> `Category::LinkedRef`
   With it one can access all refs as advertised.
 - <csr-id-eada5dfdd4981dbb032e8f155e3829eb5d1f380f/> `Category::MainRef`
   With it it will be possible to compute all paths correctly and actually
   perform certain operations as documented.
 - <csr-id-0304b7fad3ae5e3ac1fea71e30658474a770184b/> `Category::(WorktreePrivate|Bisect|Rewritten)`
 - <csr-id-612a2dbf7f70a8eb44b7278fccd4f1589749968a/> `Category::LinkedPseudoRef`
 - <csr-id-613b5844e74535d391339bd8e7c106e18257b917/> Add `Category::MainPseudoRef`
 - <csr-id-6ccfea97d30dbfa013e1633c77c5a26ab5cbaf8f/> `Category::PseudoRef`
 - <csr-id-ecd60d7a75d4aef7c37cd0b28b57a8aea1166858/> add `FullName(Ref)::category_and_shortname()`
   It's a combination of `shorten()` and `category()` for convenience.
 - <csr-id-e7e4ba2739e5a15e826b5b4d9ef2b45a1cb016cc/> `Fullname(Ref)::category()` and `Category`
   A way to classify references.
 - <csr-id-af2d399261e4131299c2279904a1f224c116db66/> FullName(Ref)::strip_prefix()
   Get a short-hand for any reference name.
 - <csr-id-e4d6685064ad2b433f8acd3a74b320bf0169a994/> Add `git_config::values::Path` for a typesafe git path
   Add a `Path` type to the `git_config::values` which
   can be interpolated according to gits own path interpolation
   rules.
 - <csr-id-cf50ae2b33da0161d801b4c0a9cd8b5d24bb3510/> Display implementation for `FullName`.
 - <csr-id-28e3251ee1996f638eaa0bc7b39b06be436f6eb7/> FullNameRef::file_name()
 - <csr-id-f6181afef285b32968b852467235edf3d7d99a66/> Add file::Store::find_packed(…, buffer)
   This makes the API complete as now there is a methods that uses the
   internal buffer, or the provided one, where both can have its benefits.
 - <csr-id-03bcac2763076bfd720b99d60fd036b4d5d00995/> add Reference::peel_to_id_in_place_packed() and Reference::follow_packed()
   This allows a stable/non-changing buffer to be used.
 - <csr-id-6a17416557112a6464e548c5de1c46e563b3a187/> Add `file::Store::iter_(prefixed_)packed()`
   These methods allow using an own packed buffer, usually obtained through
   `cached_packed_buffer()`.
 - <csr-id-9eb3a31d1f9f519e153e8df3fc3faaff278aed85/> add `file::Store::cached_packed_buffer()` for packed refs snapshots
 - <csr-id-b030884447284daf0f2251f574c0ddf9993b2792/> add file::Store::try_find_packed(…, packed_buffer)
   That way, abstractions can still be built that have other ways of
   managing the packed-refs buffer, allowing it to stay more persistent.
 - <csr-id-c0fc4f6f1b42c117275be85e1c2e6893b58007ba/> PartialNameRef<'static>::join() for building paths on the fly
 - <csr-id-b7aab9efd42975e8f2dcb5c97e51495996175702/> Allow `PartialNameRef` to be created from owned items

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-65c5589a419b2856c1576d838d4444554d7a582b/> commiting the revlog transaction is now optional.
   This also means that providing no committer despite one being needed is will cause
   the transaction to fail entirely with an error.
   
   Doing this allows users who disable the reflog not to have to deal with committer configuration
   at all.
 - <csr-id-328900add089f40d3bf9f1019c9f31663da387e2/> support for non-'static PackedRefs transactions.
   When configuring for packed-refs updates, previously one needed to
   provide a function to find objects that could not borrow data due
   to implicit 'static requirement. This has been lifted to allow
   it to access references to data on the stack.

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.20.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.19.0 (2022-11-17)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e86e159e00c9b54803abbfa09809707be7ac8aee/> `file::Transaction::rollback()` allows to explicitly roll back a pending change.
   As opposed to dropping the Transaction, this method allows to obtain all
   edits that would have been applied.
 - <csr-id-bbdb4804d8c3bd6a1fb8bea97adce509c90c5ca8/> higher performance for edits which would write the same value.
   Instead of moving them into place, we just drop them, without ever
   writing into them.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-584b705cee8be3fb68c67dcb8535b981d1efc5f4/> assure symrefs don't get deleted when moving refs to packed-refs.
   Previously it was possible for symbolic refs to be deleted right after
   they have been created or updated as they were included in the set of
   refs that was assumed to be part of packed-refs, which isn't the case
   for symbolic refs.
 - <csr-id-9f848506f5a42abc954612ea375f845e3b23ae5a/> case-insensitively conflicting references can be created even on case-insensitive filesystems*.
   The asterisk indicates that this only works if packed-refs are present
   and these references are written straight to packed references without
   ever trying to handle the otherwise conflicting loose reference files.
   
   This is done by leveraging the fact that in presence of packed-refs
   or a pending creation of packed-refs, there is no need to create
   per-file locks as concurrent transactions also have to obtain the
   packed-refs lock and fail (or wait) until it's done.
 - <csr-id-e9853dd640cf4545134aa6e0d093e560af090a2b/> instead of erroring if loose iteration is performed on missing base, correctly yield zero references.
   Previously it reported an error, now it does not and instead performs no
   iteration, which is more helpful to the user of the API I believe as
   they won't randomly fail just because somebody deleted the `refs`
   folder.
 - <csr-id-27386a96ddc022ba75730901f8bb098b9d5ff9d4/> loose ref iteration on a repo with missing 'ref/' fails when creating the iterator.
   Previously, it would fail on first iteration, making it seem like there
   is one reference even though it's just an error stating that the base
   cannot be read.
   
   This is clearly worse than making a metadata check on the filesystem,
   no matter how unlikely the case.

## 0.18.0 (2022-11-06)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-6e5c0ae63deed181419232c61896e22404e4c84a/> allow symref updates to receive reflogs if these are new…
   …and well-known on top of that, that means having an exact expectation
   on what should be present.
   
   This allows symrefs to be created with reflog.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-328900add089f40d3bf9f1019c9f31663da387e2/> support for non-'static PackedRefs transactions.
   When configuring for packed-refs updates, previously one needed to
   provide a function to find objects that could not borrow data due
   to implicit 'static requirement. This has been lifted to allow
   it to access references to data on the stack.

## 0.17.0 (2022-10-10)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-370ed3dcc393eca7a393ea0150f698a9fc844320/> `transaction::Change::new_value()` to get easy access to new values of references.
   That's more convenient than matching on the enum.
 - <csr-id-658c1257c073507327d9a50c1c89b49d17e9ccbc/> `FullName::try_from(&BString)` for convenience.
   Sometimes when matching one only has a `&BString`, and it's hard to
   convert it to `&BStr` without an extra line of code, it's cumbersome,
   so we workaround by adding another conversion.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e699291097cec346374a30c325848f787ca9d736/> `file::Transaction::prepare()` now takes two `gix_lock::acquisition::Fail` instances.
   This allows to configure the file-ref lock failure mode differently from
   the packed-refs lock failure mode, which is exactly what `git` does as
   well defaulting them to 100ms and 1000ms till lock acquisition gives up.

## 0.16.0 (2022-09-20)

<csr-id-725210dc401406fe9450eae9d375b0238d645027/>

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-725210dc401406fe9450eae9d375b0238d645027/> replace `quick-error` with `thiserror`

## 0.15.4 (2022-08-28)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-2d0b63997b276a53b3cf8f09fac51f8e3f044bcd/> Add `Reference::delete()` for simple reference deletion

## 0.15.3 (2022-08-27)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.15.2 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

## 0.15.1 (2022-08-17)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-1d2003519e3b0f745af1524a32f2816475024b31/> always update modification date when packed refs are forcefully reloaded.
   The latter happens right after the file was written, which means we
   definitely have to update our modification date or else the buffer
   will be read again next time somebody asks for an up-to-date version.
   
   The ordering of operations is such that at worst, the buffer is loaded
   again instead of keeping an outdated version of it, which would happen
   if the metadata is read afterwards.

## 0.15.0 (2022-07-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4607a18e24b8270c182663a434b79dff8761db0e/> Add `store::WriteRefLog::Always` to unconditionally write reflogs.
 - <csr-id-f3c609f0af00aa280649975b0705a3cfaad8a0e5/> Allow `Reference` to be serialized/deserialized with `serde`.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0f753e922e313f735ed267f913366771e9de1111/> `Target(Ref)?::try_name()` now returns `Option<&FullNameRef>`.
   That way, the name is actually directly usable in most methods that
   require a validated name as input.

## 0.14.0 (2022-06-13)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.13.0 (2022-05-18)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4a5176a78b64981ce5612b88c7736b7323aa8cdd/> ref iteration for worktrees.
   It merges the iteration result of private worktree refs along with
   all shared common references references.
 - <csr-id-9cccce35e527cdda58e01b03cd335a527418cf14/> `Category::LinkedRef`
   With it one can access all refs as advertised.
 - <csr-id-eada5dfdd4981dbb032e8f155e3829eb5d1f380f/> `Category::MainRef`
   With it it will be possible to compute all paths correctly and actually
   perform certain operations as documented.
 - <csr-id-0304b7fad3ae5e3ac1fea71e30658474a770184b/> `Category::(WorktreePrivate|Bisect|Rewritten)`
 - <csr-id-612a2dbf7f70a8eb44b7278fccd4f1589749968a/> `Category::LinkedPseudoRef`
 - <csr-id-613b5844e74535d391339bd8e7c106e18257b917/> Add `Category::MainPseudoRef`
 - <csr-id-6ccfea97d30dbfa013e1633c77c5a26ab5cbaf8f/> `Category::PseudoRef`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d6299f47f41397c1c72035a86b94d1c263b5b98/> `Transaction::commit(…)` takes `gix-actor::SignatureRef` instead of `…::Signature`.
   This makes the API more versatile and corrects a shortcoming that was
   caused by `SignatureRef` previously being unable to serialize itself.
 - <csr-id-f1dbb6bd4534527b6f1f2aba2a562dd4e64cf55d/> remove `FullName::to_ref()` in favor of `•::as_ref()`.
   This became possible now that `FullNameRef` is a proper ref, not just
   ref-like.
 - <csr-id-1611c3ddff6c930deaa4c2440383f5684c029b28/> rename `PartialNameRef` to `PartialNameCow`
   Because this is what it is, which also implies that it's not `Copy`
   anymore which a `Ref` would definitely be.
   
   The reason we need this to be a `Cow` is to support passing ownership.
 - <csr-id-8a92ec9834b6d5aa3057c5509f6c13b6a6cd6e1b/> remove `Store` from public API
   It is unclear if ref-tables, which are the reason for it to exist in
   the first place, will fit into the concept as they might not support
   worktrees. It's entirely unclear how this works.
   
   Maybe there can be a non-worktree version of the store with work-trees
   only being supported by the file based ref database, and ref-tables
   remaining a server-side feature.
 - <csr-id-2becffc85ff6225522fe38482739fb1406ae1060/> rename `file::Store::base()` to `git_dir()`.
   That way it is clearer what it actually is especially in presence
   of the newly added `file::Store::common_dir()` method.
   
   That way, work-trees can eventually be properly supported.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0ace957c595c8a38afb7de1462cdc73b617d2a76/> Turn `FullNameRef` into an actual reference type.
   That way `Cow<'_, FullNameRef>` works as expected.

## 0.12.1 (2022-04-05)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-1611c3ddff6c930deaa4c2440383f5684c029b28/> rename `PartialNameRef` to `PartialNameCow`
   Because this is what it is, which also implies that it's not `Copy`

   The reason we need this to be a `Cow` is to support passing ownership.
 - <csr-id-8a92ec9834b6d5aa3057c5509f6c13b6a6cd6e1b/> remove `Store` from public API

### New Features

 - <csr-id-ecd60d7a75d4aef7c37cd0b28b57a8aea1166858/> add `FullName(Ref)::category_and_shortname()`
   It's a combination of `shorten()` and `category()` for convenience.
 - <csr-id-9cccce35e527cdda58e01b03cd335a527418cf14/> `Category::LinkedRef`
   With it one can access all refs as advertised.
 - <csr-id-eada5dfdd4981dbb032e8f155e3829eb5d1f380f/> `Category::MainRef`
   With it it will be possible to compute all paths correctly and actually
   perform certain operations as documented.

 - <csr-id-612a2dbf7f70a8eb44b7278fccd4f1589749968a/> `Category::LinkedPseudoRef`
 - <csr-id-613b5844e74535d391339bd8e7c106e18257b917/> Add `Category::MainPseudoRef`
 - <csr-id-6ccfea97d30dbfa013e1633c77c5a26ab5cbaf8f/> `Category::PseudoRef`

## 0.12.0 (2022-04-03)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e7e4ba2739e5a15e826b5b4d9ef2b45a1cb016cc/> `Fullname(Ref)::category()` and `Category`
   A way to classify references.
 - <csr-id-af2d399261e4131299c2279904a1f224c116db66/> FullName(Ref)::strip_prefix()
   Get a short-hand for any reference name.
 - <csr-id-e4d6685064ad2b433f8acd3a74b320bf0169a994/> Add `gix_config::values::Path` for a typesafe git path
   Add a `Path` type to the `gix_config::values` which
   can be interpolated according to gits own path interpolation
   rules.
 - <csr-id-28e3251ee1996f638eaa0bc7b39b06be436f6eb7/> FullNameRef::file_name()
 - <csr-id-cf50ae2b33da0161d801b4c0a9cd8b5d24bb3510/> Display implementation for `FullName`.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-42e0487286c1f745837c0ce337ed7c9d86b14516/> support Rust 1.52

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-7984e19417dff13445f3ef2e15dea96bbd194ce5/> `Target::as_(id|name)` -> `Target::try_(id|name)`
   Conform to naming conventions, whenever something returns an option
   or Result while there is a more direct name that panics, prefix `try_`.

## 0.11.0 (2022-01-23)

<csr-id-c46dec311c76a83dba136be5dba6b70d739c354d/>
<csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/>
<csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-28e3251ee1996f638eaa0bc7b39b06be436f6eb7/> FullNameRef::file_name()
 - <csr-id-f6181afef285b32968b852467235edf3d7d99a66/> Add file::Store::find_packed(…, buffer)
   This makes the API complete as now there is a methods that uses the
   internal buffer, or the provided one, where both can have its benefits.
 - <csr-id-03bcac2763076bfd720b99d60fd036b4d5d00995/> add Reference::peel_to_id_in_place_packed() and Reference::follow_packed()
   This allows a stable/non-changing buffer to be used.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-42e0487286c1f745837c0ce337ed7c9d86b14516/> support Rust 1.52

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dea6659a404bf8b2ad1290549653c776ec04f964/> Required `object_hash` as parameter when instantiating any Store
   This is needed to choose the correct kind of object hash in a couple of
   situations, and future-proofs it for when ref-table arrives.
 - remove `Target::must_exist()`
   It was a remainder of an old API which since has been replaced
   with a more explicit approach.
 - remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - move gix_pack::data::Object to gix_object::Data, massively alter gix_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.

## 0.10.0 (2021-11-29)

<csr-id-951c050ecbb70c9de216603e55c7cfbc89a067e3/>
<csr-id-0e1875363fea09452789d7a90fc6860a7996d6d3/>

With this release, `file::Store` is easier to use due to thread-safe handling of an internal and shared
packed-buffer instance. An API for passing it as parameter like before is still present, allowing to use
a 'frozen' version of the packed buffer for any amount of operations.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6a17416557112a6464e548c5de1c46e563b3a187/> Add `file::Store::iter_(prefixed_)packed()`.
   
   These methods allow using an own packed buffer, usually obtained through
   `cached_packed_buffer()`.
 - <csr-id-9eb3a31d1f9f519e153e8df3fc3faaff278aed85/> add `file::Store::cached_packed_buffer()` for packed refs snapshots
 - <csr-id-b030884447284daf0f2251f574c0ddf9993b2792/> add file::Store::try_find_packed(…, packed_buffer)
   That way, abstractions can still be built that have other ways of
   managing the packed-refs buffer, allowing it to stay more persistent.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b431fb0fb58b5e2e8aadbbd6aead55c0e42bd67b/> rename `file::Store::packed_buffer()` to `…::open_packed_buffer()`
   This makes much clearer what it actually does, as previously it might
   have been a stored packed buffer as well.
 - <csr-id-80f3d504eeb669f16c5621fac06f6c763ce84e47/> file::Store::from(PathBuf) removed
   At this low level, it's important to be clear about RefLogs and rather
   force the caller to specify the ref-log mode. Technically it depends
   on a few factors, `gix` deals with them, but certainly
   shouldn't default to anything without being clear.
 - <csr-id-bfb32aee4e64fd6b1f18c830623cc3fddd059874/> Reference log line access
   `Reference::log_iter(…)` now is a platform instead of a forward iterator,
   which requires a call to `.all()` to return the forward iterator like
   previously.
   
   `Reference::log_iter_rev(…)` was removed in favor of
   `Reference::log_iter(…).rev()`.
 - <csr-id-5d498a33236391d8e456f267b1bf6af24de66f11/> file::Store::iter() is now a platform, with `.all()` and `.prefixed(…)` respectively
   This way, it's possible to keep shared ownership of the packed buffer
   while allowing the exact same iterator machinery to work as before.
 - <csr-id-4641499abe00acf6eef0ab6d6bf261b0a27795f8/> file::ReferenceExt::follow(…) now without packed refs parameter
 - <csr-id-55940eb8316d83ac1376c57ba25b3115d62f2012/> `file::ReferenceExt::peel_to_id_in_place(…)` now without packed-refs buffer
   It is instead read from the internally synchronized buffer, shared
   across all instances.
 - <csr-id-15d429bb50602363292453606902bdce5042d9a5/> file::Store::(try_)find(…, packed) was removed
   The packed buffer is now handled internally while loading it on demand.
   When compiled with `gix-features/parallel` the `file::Store` remains
   send and sync.
   
   The packed refs buffer is shared across clones and it's recommended
   to clone one `file::Store` instance per thread, each of which can
   use its own namespace.
 - <csr-id-95247322a8191edfa7fac9c5aa72b40239f3aa88/> move `gix_ref::file::WriteRefLog` to `gix_ref::store::WriteRefLog`

### Other (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-951c050ecbb70c9de216603e55c7cfbc89a067e3/> Reference::logs() -> Reference::log_iter()
   The latter now returns a standard Platform to iterate over all
   reflog entries from oldest to newest or vice versa.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0e1875363fea09452789d7a90fc6860a7996d6d3/> `file::Store::base` is now `file::Store::base()` and read-only
   That way, file databases can't be repositioned anymore, it's recommended
   to recreate it if that's desired.

## 0.9.1 (2021-11-16)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c0fc4f6f1b42c117275be85e1c2e6893b58007ba/> PartialNameRef<'static>::join() for building paths on the fly
 - <csr-id-b7aab9efd42975e8f2dcb5c97e51495996175702/> Allow `PartialNameRef` to be created from owned items

## v0.9.0 (2021-10-19)

A maintenance release to properly dealing with previously breaking changes in `gix-hash`.

## v0.8.0 (2021-10-15)

<csr-id-4ed4b2da50557aff540685441f4b5c7d5e582977/>
<csr-id-293bfc0278c5983c0beaec93253fb51f00d81156/>
<csr-id-90e6128727932f917c485f411e623fc6a9c2ad4d/>

This release contains no functional changes, but is considered breaking for safety reasons 
as `gix-traverse` is signalling a breaking change.

### Other

 - <csr-id-293bfc0278c5983c0beaec93253fb51f00d81156/> loose reference iteration with non-dir prefixes…
   Previously it was expected for the prefix `Path` to always exist for
   the prefix to be valid. This, however, is not similar to packed
   prefixes, which allow non-dir prefixes as well.
   
   Now we will check if the prefix is actually a directory, and if not
   split it into its parent directory and the filename portion. The latter
   is then used for prefix matching file names within that directory.

### Other

## v0.7.3 (2021-09-10)

<csr-id-293bfc0278c5983c0beaec93253fb51f00d81156/>

- Compatibility with Rust 1.55. It informed about the incorrect usage of `std::io::ErrorKind::Other` which this crate also dependent on causing
  runtime bugs. The latter were detected by tests and this release contains the fix to not rely on certain behaviour anymore.
