/// A cache for efficiently executing operations on directories and files which are encountered in sorted order.
/// That way, these operations can be re-used for subsequent invocations in the same directory.
///
/// This cache can be configured to create directories efficiently, read git-ignore files and git-attribute files,
/// in any combination.
///
/// A cache for directory creation to reduce the amount of stat calls when creating
/// directories safely, that is without following symlinks that might be on the way.
///
/// As a special case, it offers a 'prefix' which (by itself) is assumed to exist and may contain symlinks.
/// Everything past that prefix boundary must not contain a symlink. We do this by allowing any input path.
///
/// Another added benefit is its ability to store the path of full path of the entry to which leading directories
/// are to be created to avoid allocating memory.
///
/// For this to work, it remembers the last 'good' path to a directory and assumes that all components of it
/// are still valid, too.
/// As directories are created, the cache will be adjusted to reflect the latest seen directory.
///
/// The caching is only useful if consecutive calls to create a directory are using a sorted list of entries.
