## Provide traits and utilities for providing progress information. These can then be rendered
## using facilities of the `prodash` crate.
progress = ["prodash"]

## Use scoped threads and channels to parallelize common workloads on multiple objects. If enabled, it is used everywhere
## where it makes sense.
## As caches are likely to be used and instantiated per thread, more memory will be used on top of the costs for threads.
## The `threading` module will contain thread-safe primitives for shared ownership and mutation, otherwise these will be their single threaded counterparts.
## This way, single-threaded applications don't have to pay for threaded primitives.
parallel = ["crossbeam-utils", "crossbeam-channel", "num_cpus", "jwalk", "parking_lot"]
#* an in-memory unidirectional pipe using `bytes` as efficient transfer mechanism.
io-pipe = ["bytes"]
## provide a proven and fast `crc32` implementation.
crc32 = ["crc32fast"]

#! ### Mutually Exclusive ZLIB

## Enable the usage of zlib related utilities to compress or decompress data.
## By default it uses a pure rust implementation which is slower than the **zlib-ng-compat** version, but might be relevant if you prefer a pure-rust build
## and reduced performance is acceptable. Note that a competitive Zlib implementation is critical to `gitoxide's` object database performance.
## Additional backends are supported, each of which overriding the default Rust backend.
zlib = ["flate2", "flate2/rust_backend", "quick-error"]
## Use a C-based backend which can compress and decompress significantly faster.
zlib-ng-compat = ["flate2/zlib-ng-compat"]
## available for completeness even though it's the default - it may be chosen for more specific feature flag names, instead of a bare `zlib`.
zlib-rust-backend = ["flate2/rust_backend"]

#! ### Mutually Exclusive SHA1
## A fast SHA1 implementation is critical to `gitoxide's` object database performance
## A multi-crate implementation that can use hardware acceleration, thus bearing the potential for up to 2Gb/s throughput on
## CPUs that support it, like AMD Ryzen or Intel Core i3, as well as Apple Silicon like M1.
## Takes precedence over `rustsha1` if both are specified.
fast-sha1 = ["sha-1"]
## A standard and well performing pure Rust implementation of Sha1. Will significantly slow down various git operations.
rustsha1 = ["sha1_smol"]

#! ### Optional Dependencies
#!
#! - **`time`** - make the `time` module available with access to the local time as configured by the system.
#! - **`walkdir`**
#!     - Makes facilities of the `walkdir` crate partially available.
#!     - In conjunction with the **parallel** feature, directory walking will be parallel instead behind a compatible interface.

#! ### Other

## Count cache hits and misses and print that debug information on drop.
## Caches implement this by default, which costs nothing unless this feature is enabled
