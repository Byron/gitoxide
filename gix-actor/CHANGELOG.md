## 0.26.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.25.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-ef54aab9e5521add4154ee8d902d62612a9d8d4a/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-ef54aab9e5521add4154ee8d902d62612a9d8d4a/> switch `nom` to `winnow` in remaining uses in `gix-object`, `gix-ref`, and `gix-actor` for ~20% more performance.
   It's likely that over time, these parsers will get even faster due to improvements to `winnow`.
   Thanks, Ed Page, for single-handedly performing this transition.

   * `SignatureRef::actor()` is renamed to `identity()` as it now returns this type.
* `SignatureRef::empty()` was removed as it is only another name for `default()`.

## 0.20.0 (2023-04-19)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-634429a9c09dc9116bdb1c2317e7a96f27f2ddc8/> replace `quick-error` with `thiserror`

## 0.17.2 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/> move loose header manipulation from git-pack to git-object

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-89a41bf2b37db29b9983b4e5492cfd67ed490b23/> remove local-time-support feature toggle.
   We treat local time as default feature without a lot of fuzz, and
   will eventually document that definitive support needs a compile
   time switch in the compiler (`--cfg unsound_local_offset` or something).
   
   One day it will perish. Failure is possible anyway and we will write
   code to deal with it while minimizing the amount of system time
   fetches when asking for the current local time.
 - <csr-id-5c8b0a44acfa708ef4ffe28cfde0dfed52b29d7c/> `Time::time` -> `Time::seconds_since_unix_epoch`
   And `Time::offset` to `Time::offset_in_seconds`.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fd287530e06ada04b811d9c8526eb698bc4c90fe/> `From` implementation from `&Signature` to `SignatureRef<'_>`.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-027c43ce3b0206607b40882a0a1b69fa25b8d70f/> `SignatureRef::actor()` to more easily compare name and email.
   Comparing anything with actual timestamps will of cause fail eventually
   and make tests flaky.
 - <csr-id-a39bf71531ee0a6c8db082758d3212c805ce2bf0/> support for trimming of whitespace around name and email
   It's separated from parsing to assure we can round-trip, but it's
   made easy to obtain trimmed results using new methods.
   
   This high-level git-repository will also trim by default now.
 - <csr-id-70a259c11f12f55a5f26b02cac21ec000c76fb8b/> `Time::seconds()` shortcut
 - <csr-id-705adfd5a5cbec0498a3d67065f7296c0dab8337/> SignatureRef is now Copy
   It's a type with only copyable types inside, so should be copy itself.
   This makes it less awkward to use as well.
 - <csr-id-13799e200508dc67ea4fe6f3c97c47b50694cada/> Time::new(seconds_since_epoch, offset)
 - <csr-id-77ef2cb819f21ddc5d1ee9e94b5961e3ca5b3139/> `Time::default()`
 - <csr-id-f99851bb272ce2d81704712b9e70edaddc442589/> keep feature documentation inline with manifests

</details>

## 0.17.0 (2023-01-06)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.16.0 (2022-12-30)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.15.0 (2022-12-19)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.14.1 (2022-11-27)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fd287530e06ada04b811d9c8526eb698bc4c90fe/> `From` implementation from `&Signature` to `SignatureRef<'_>`.

## 0.14.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.13.0 (2022-10-10)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.12.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

## 0.11.4 (2022-08-24)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

## 0.11.3 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

## 0.11.2 (2022-08-19)

A maintenance release with a dependency update.

## 0.11.1 (2022-08-17)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-027c43ce3b0206607b40882a0a1b69fa25b8d70f/> `SignatureRef::actor()` to more easily compare name and email.
   Comparing anything with actual timestamps will of cause fail eventually
   and make tests flaky.

## 0.11.0 (2022-07-22)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-89a41bf2b37db29b9983b4e5492cfd67ed490b23/> remove local-time-support feature toggle.
   We treat local time as default feature without a lot of fuzz, and
   will eventually document that definitive support needs a compile
   time switch in the compiler (`--cfg unsound_local_offset` or something).
   
   One day it will perish. Failure is possible anyway and we will write
   code to deal with it while minimizing the amount of system time
   fetches when asking for the current local time.

## 0.10.1 (2022-06-13)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.10.0 (2022-05-18)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.9.0 (2022-04-03)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-a39bf71531ee0a6c8db082758d3212c805ce2bf0/> support for trimming of whitespace around name and email
   It's separated from parsing to assure we can round-trip, but it's
   made easy to obtain trimmed results using new methods.
   
   This high-level git-repository will also trim by default now.
 - <csr-id-70a259c11f12f55a5f26b02cac21ec000c76fb8b/> `Time::seconds()` shortcut
 - <csr-id-705adfd5a5cbec0498a3d67065f7296c0dab8337/> SignatureRef is now Copy
   It's a type with only copyable types inside, so should be copy itself.
   This makes it less awkward to use as well.
 - <csr-id-13799e200508dc67ea4fe6f3c97c47b50694cada/> Time::new(seconds_since_epoch, offset)
 - <csr-id-77ef2cb819f21ddc5d1ee9e94b5961e3ca5b3139/> `Time::default()`

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5c8b0a44acfa708ef4ffe28cfde0dfed52b29d7c/> `Time::time` -> `Time::seconds_since_unix_epoch`
   And `Time::offset` to `Time::offset_in_seconds`.

## 0.8.1 (2022-02-06)

### New Features
