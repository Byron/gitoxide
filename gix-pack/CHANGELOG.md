## 0.42.0 (2023-09-08)

<csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-0357b6cdb11b098fd54cd0c3df6c617d0b44a1c2/> Add `generate` and `streaming-input` feature toggles.
   That way, it's possible to not compile a bunch of code in `gix` if
   the writing of packs isn't required.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-96a07e08e6090222cf398b46aa8d46b56f81f14d/> Use `Vec::resize()` instead of set_len()
   Otherwise it's possible for uninitialized memory to be used as if it was initialized,
   which can lead to strange behaviour.
   
   As the buffer is re-used, it's not actually zeroing that much memory either.

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/> update to the latest `prodash`
   It makes proper usage of `Progress` types easier and allows them to be used
   as `dyn` traits as well.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-24dd870919ba444aa8099c63a78ea120d47ec28e/> use `prodash::Count` to indicate that nothing more than counting is performed, in place of `prodash::Progress`
 - <csr-id-4b74996b19176cb0f00860b3db5a27819d63e7d0/> Make usage of decompression context explicit.
   That way, the context can be reused which is more efficient than recreating
   it from scratch for every little delta to decompress.
   
   This leads to a performance gain of 1.3%.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.41.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-93feea269eebd114e866e6f29f4a73c0096df9e0/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-93feea269eebd114e866e6f29f4a73c0096df9e0/> split tests off into their own crate to allow feature toggles.
   That way we can test with the `parallel` feature and won't have to
   create bogus feature toggles that are only used for testing, yet visbible
   to users.

## 0.38.0 (2023-06-22)

<csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/> Add `clippy::redundant-closure-for-method-calls` lint

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3cffa268460eb2d41bd6a30d45778b88db4ec602/> provide basic `tracing` spans for common operations.
   This is just the beginning and more crates will integrate with it over time.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-b9eb40730b53f788d2e4bffe4ef6d9028440782e/> revert 3a2d5286084597d4c68549903709cda77dda4357 to fix 'incorrect data check' error.
   This error could occour in heavily threaded code for unknown reason.
   But maybe it's due to threads somehow not cleaning up their reused decompressor properly
   (maybe related to the zlib-ng version). It's strange and sad as this really costs performnace
   for no good reason.
 - <csr-id-8817c248dd7c6453ced654d4df304f98ff18ecda/> don't crash when object validation failed during verification.
   When objects can't be serialized, they will trigger an error that manifests as IO error.
   Previously we didn't think of the possibility that writing to an im-memory buffer could fail
   would indeed panic during verification.
   
   This is now fixed.
 - <csr-id-cd747f9292fb034e7fd5ee6c5a94a4e53df42e86/> ScopedJoinHandle is not always available

## 0.36.0 (2023-06-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3a2d5286084597d4c68549903709cda77dda4357/> improve performance by reducing the trashing of `zlib::Inflate`.
   Previously, for every zlib inflate operation, we would allocate memory
   due to the creation of a decompressor.
   
   This is now avoided by reusing thread-local copies of such a decompressor,
   which is reused and reset instead.
 - <csr-id-14e7ea0217af8a04ed2b50ff7b13c28335c29022/> improve performance by avoiding zeroying buffers.
   Previously we would use `resize(new_len, 0)` to resize buffers, even though
   these values would then be overwritten (or the buffer isn't available).
   
   Now we use `set_len(new_len)` after calling `reserve` to do the same, but safe
   a memset.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-977e135bfa00bdbc1a8f8324f85347ec9078c84f/> static linked list delta cache with memory cap
   Previously, the 64 slot big LRU cache for pack deltas didn't
   use any memory limit which could lead to memory exhaustion in the
   face of untypical, large objects.
   
   Now we add a generous default limit to do *better* in such situations.
   It's worth noting though that that even without any cache, the working
   set of buffers to do delta resolution takes considerable memory, despite
   trying to keep it minimal.
   
   Note that for bigger objects, the cache is now not used at all, which probably
   leads to terrible performance as not even the base object can be cached.
 - <csr-id-f89cbc675b0acc67322e289e7b3a17288b9eae27/> check for interrupt more often
   Previously when traversing a pack it could appear to hang as checks
   were only performed on chunk or base (of a delta-tree) level.
   
   Now interrupt checks are performed more often to stop all work much quicker.
 - <csr-id-923692bcda698b45d3d1ad518b29f6d30b23fbc0/> memory capped hashmap as pack delta cache won't trash memory as much.
   Previously it would take a buffer from the free-list, copy data into it, and
   when exceeding the capacity loose it entirely.
   Now the freelist is handled correctly.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d22dd8fcc22e8dbe30524a1bdddc09bc841db341/> index-backed tree traversal with a form of work-stealing.
   When delta-trees are unbalanced, in pathological cases it's possible that that one thread
   ends up with more than half of the work. In this case it's required that it manages to
   spawn its own threads to parallelize the work it has.
 - <csr-id-0fa04bcbdf3102c5435e64cfef894a1bfc8d6e7b/> make current thread-count accessible in slice-workers.
   Threads started for working on an entry in a slice can now see the amount
   of threads left for use (and manipulate that variable) which effectively
   allows them to implement their own parallelization on top of the current one.
   
   This is useful if there is there is very imbalanced work within the slice itself.
   
   While at it, we also make consumer functions mutable as they exsit per thread.

## 0.34.0 (2023-04-26)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

## 0.32.0 (2023-03-04)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ce182d6dae7e277d104893f0eec3285709946233/> don't over-estimate the number of objects to be received in the indexing phase.
   Previously, it would work with a number that is pessimistically duplicated as each object
   could in theory be a ref-delta, which then causes another base to be added to the stream,
   duplicating the amount of objects we need to account for in the acceleration data structure,
   which unfortunatelly cannot actually grow dynamically without violating invariants.
   
   Now we simply don't try to estimata the number of ref-deltas (which don't exist here anymore)
   at this stage.

## 0.31.0 (2023-03-01)

<csr-id-3ba25202240d13fdda998581297616afe06422ca/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-3ba25202240d13fdda998581297616afe06422ca/> remove `dashmap` in favor of own sharded concurrent hashmap.
   This speeds up multi-threaded counting greatly, and despite it
   using shared memory which makes it quite wasteful, it is possible to
   outperform `git` with it if enough cores are thrown at the problem.
   
   Single-threaded performance is still lacking though, ultimately it needs
   caches to accelerate the counting stage to hopefully be competitive.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f0e40ecddaf1211f76ed60ef30cf03dcfd53a7ab/> add `wasm` feature toggle to allow compilation to wasm32-unknown-unknown
 - <csr-id-3ba25202240d13fdda998581297616afe06422ca/> remove `dashmap` in favor of own sharded concurrent hashmap.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6c4c196c9bc6c2171dc4dc58b69bd5ef53226e29/> add `wasm` feature toggle to let parts of `git-pack` build on wasm32.
   It's a breaking change because we also start using the `dep:` syntax for declaring
   references to optional dependencies, which will prevent them from being automatically
   available as features.
   
   Besides that, it adds the `wasm` feature toggle to allow compiling to `wasm32` targets.

## 0.30.3 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/> remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - <csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/> move git_pack::data::Object to git_object::Data, massively alter git_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.
 - <csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/> move loose header manipulation from git-pack to git-object

### Other (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b46347fd3d50886eeca500e31e1e12b354711309/> `index::write::Outcome::index_kind` -> `::index_version`.
 - <csr-id-591afd56d9862a6348ef8b3af61798004b36aa19/> `bundle::write::Options::index_kind` -> `::index_version`.
 - <csr-id-2f2d856efe733d3cf81110c0e0607d2e7c40d968/> Avoid duplicate module paths in 'tree' and 'commit'

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5a75afe0467e4a84323ea10172eed835cc7fae4c/> Reading and writing empty packs is explicitly allowed.
   This can happen when sending packs that don't actually contain changes,
   but need to be sent to conform to the protocol.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6c4c196c9bc6c2171dc4dc58b69bd5ef53226e29/> add `wasm` feature toggle to let parts of `git-pack` build on wasm32.
   It's a breaking change because we also start using the `dep:` syntax for declaring
   references to optional dependencies, which will prevent them from being automatically
   available as features.
   
   Besides that, it adds the `wasm` feature toggle to allow compiling to `wasm32` targets.
 - <csr-id-95210cb2ba85f75148b4ef48ccea9d9f8a0a0114/> Provide optional `candidates` for ambigious entries during `lookup_prefix()`
   The candidate entries are all entries matching a given prefix.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-37f3a675d7fa931f5d3f38e91df74ec0b517422b/> move `data::ResolveBase` into `data::decode_entry::`; unify `decode_entry|decode_header::Error` into `decode::Error`.
 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-8c5ae77f06a64c57df9a9ad1190266896a223dbe/> Remove deprecated compound and linked object databases
   The dynamic/general store is the only maintained can-do-it-all
   DB now.
 - <csr-id-a79a7fb638b45df88af0d0d5fc9ada6d824bc328/> Improve method signatures of `cache::Tree::*`
 - <csr-id-91d047658b114f372735116c9d8e6962a3873137/> cleanup and unify `verify_integrity()` method signature
   Previously they used many different ways of handling their parameters
   despite all boiling down to calling the same 'index::File::traverse()`
   method.
   
   This allows for more reuse of `Options` structs and generally makes
   clearer how these optinos are used.
 - <csr-id-2cf7727228e1d8094ffd2eec6746006348c39eab/> `index::File::traverse()` now returns an `Outcome` struct instead of tuple of 3 fields
 - <csr-id-bf04644ab75ed1969507f957dc8d4868790d462d/> remove `Option<impl Progress>` in favor of `impl Progress`
 - <csr-id-6829e5e5d6aed1e6c87647144e2dd76a1e4b9f1f/> multi-index integrity check; use `integrity::Outcome` for various integrity checks
 - <csr-id-d851bede97801096d188ff6af06c98a79fe276db/> remove unnecessary `Arc` around `should_interrupt` flag
 - <csr-id-c2679a03358b9c19d63ed1af1cd57324c6381447/> remove Sha1 mentions in `index::verify::Mode::*` variants
   The hash is repository defined and not hard-coded
 - <csr-id-80b120d3278e46429f848df7af3db13413c36649/> introduce `index::File::verify_integrity(…, pack: Option<PackContext>, …)`, replacing tuple
   This allows for more documentation on what input is required there and
   generally makes for an easier to use API.
 - <csr-id-79dc0d5ba6fa31ddd5c075693ffdc6496c1eaded/> rename `oid::try_from()` to `try_from_bytes()`, add `from_bytes_unchecked()`
   This change was done in the name of consistency, as `from_bytes()` is
   used in many other git-* crates
 - <csr-id-2ef9a8424af51310db8c1e6df31dde9953ed3d21/> Change accessors named `hash_kind()` to `object_hash()` for consistency
 - <csr-id-b76f6be6c5baa6cf613a174241f007e92bf5ba36/> consistently use `object_hash` instead of `hash_kind`
 - <csr-id-629412b4cb192614b7eff08dbf203e3448c902c1/> data::Entry::from_read() now takes a hash lengths as parameter
   That way ref-deltas can be interepreted without hard-coding SHA1
 - <csr-id-851dc2c52fa8e204ba2d5ced8fb0959a889869d8/> data::Entry::from_bytes(…, hash_len) takes new parameter
   The hash-len tells it how to interpret ref-delta objects, which
   store the complete hash of the base object.
   
   This is now entirely configurable.
 - <csr-id-db8c8c41b4ced0fc296d3877883d801e77d550ae/> `index::File::at()` with git_hash::Kind parameter
   It will allow to assume different hashes even in the index file format
   which isn't yet capable of storing this information.
 - <csr-id-e6a3c9f72332b524b143bc94ee9df0a6db11e864/> `data::File::at()` and `Bundle::at()` now have `hash_kind` parameter
   It's used to configure the kind of hash to assume when reading packs and
   indices.
 - <csr-id-82b9b33bd5f4c3c1721a5093de2cedc62cb10565/> move `bundle::Location` to `data::entry::Location`
   The latter place best describes its purpose.
 - <csr-id-3f05fea55dc8acce1ed62ecbe4e0a1394f2720b7/> remove `make_object_cache` parameter from `git_pack::data::output::count::objects()`
   It now is an implementation detail of the Find trait.
 - <csr-id-e7526b2a7b51cbac4018e1ab3b623a85987fadc2/> parallel utilities now use `Send + Clone` insted of `Send + Sync`
   This helps to assure that thread-local computations always work with the
   kind of types we provide. The ones that are carrying out actions are
   notably not `Sync` anymore.
   
   We cater to that by defining our bounds accordingly, but for those
   who want to use other utilities that need Sync, using types like
   `Repository` and `thread_local!()` is the only way to make this
   work.
 - <csr-id-e8b091943f0c9a26317da0003f7fcdf5a56ef21a/> Rename gix->ein and gixp->gix

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-9b9f10ad862b5e097c836c51df1eb98607df5ae1/> remove unnecessary unsafe by using `chunks_mut()`
   This was probably a left-over from times where there was a static
   requirement on the chunks processing. Maybe… .
 - <csr-id-e0b8636f96e4bfe1bc72b5aa6ad4c4c8538ff92c/> replace bare u32 `data::Id` typedef
 - <csr-id-71c628d46088ab455b54eb2330d24dcff96c911d/> Use 'cache::Object' trait where it matters
 - <csr-id-8fe461281842b58aa11437445637c6e587bedd63/> split data::output::count::objects into files

### Performance

 - <csr-id-f9232acf8e52f8cd95520d122469e136eb07b39f/> ObjectID specific hashers, using the fact that object ids are hashes

### Other

 - <csr-id-e6ff1a885889cf88f6b34b1193aa03d8bce16af5/> :File uses its hash_len parameter
 - <csr-id-f48630ba8f745c2ec61a1e3c51fa63a1789a088c/> :Find implementation for Rc

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ec58bef84d620360dc52e34e173ace1310f74c85/> reduce memory usage for pack resolution by 18%…
   …compared to where it started out before.
   
   This is the result of using u32 intead of usize where possible,
   leveraging the object limit of u32 in packs.
   
   This change makes the biggest difference by not keeping the decompressed
   memory of leaf nodes alive for longer than needed, at the cost of
   some code duplication which could be extracted into a function if one
   was inclined to deal with the boilerplate and lots of generics.
 - <csr-id-49d168a8859c6b5a9e7ef58cd836093212c2c7ad/> Allow verification of empty packs and indices.
   Empty packs are fine, even though the implementation should probably
   assure to not write them, or remove them after having been written.
 - <csr-id-a745512185fb0a46e35daaa6d28829aec05edb55/> increase pack-receive performance using a BufWriter
   Previously the NamedTempFile would receive every little write request
   for millions of objects, consuming considerable amounts of time.
   
   Now a buf writer alleviates this issue entirely.
 - <csr-id-0b6ed60f842f0a36f61f187651080540a358758e/> `bundle::write::Error` is now publicly available
 - <csr-id-d9451e8d7fc39c252042f9d2447061262c16ae7a/> downgrade dashmap to 4.0 to avoid unsoundness.
   See https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap/issues/167 for tracking
   progress on resolving the issue.
 - <csr-id-42e0487286c1f745837c0ce337ed7c9d86b14516/> support Rust 1.52
 - <csr-id-84ade1d23060f10bf6c8529f8f693d06660b4f4e/> Allow resolution of in-pack ref-deltas
   This finally allows delta tree caches to be used on typical small packs
   returned by GitHub.
 - <csr-id-ba92cc09ba41fe4c9a9097bfeb8d18016408fcdf/> don't try to short-cut detection of large offsets when writing index files
   The code incorrectly assumed that the input is sorted by offsets, with
   the largest offset being last, even though by all means that's not the
   case.
 - <csr-id-6d3f52dc13d7243a6bce6dab89a985114a75d94b/> Avoid the dashmap being cloned for each thread
   Intead, share it by reference, it's sync after all.
   
   This issue was introduced when switching to a `Send + Clone` model,
   instead of `Send + Sync`, to allow thread-local caches in database
   handles of all kinds.
 - <csr-id-b605c1fa0494b10872d3c2e6ecce0e39f1a90a9e/> linked::Store now assures unique IDs across compound stores
 - <csr-id-20b3994206aa5bc5e35cbbc9c8f8f99187077f79/> Adjust size-hints of resolving entries iterator and use the upper bound in delta tree
   The delta-tree is a data structure that actually heavily relies on
   favorable allocation and a known amount of objects in order to
   provide front and back buffers. However, this is an implementation
   detail and they don't have to stay consistent at all especially
   after growing the buffer by pushing to it.
   
   Interestingly, the VecDeque internally over-allocates as well which
   definitely helps the example of `as_mut_slices()`, otherwise
   it could also suffer from the assertions that trigger here.
 - <csr-id-d8fe8141e80a9e9a433b5e1a072b850325c806c8/> don't put more objects into the pack cache than needed
   Previously when accessing a packed object, it would store the base
   object into the pack cache (if it wasn't retrieved from there)
   which is great if that operation is free.
   
   Since it isn't, it's better not to stress the cache with puts
   and trash more objects than necessary.
   
   Now only the last decompressed object will be put into the LRU cache.
 - <csr-id-faf6f813927720c5adf62102f9ce46606ff2617c/> don't include submodules in count…
   …to avoid dealing with missing objects.
   
   It's still a good idea to handle these gracefully though, git itself
   seems to ignore them.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-25209454d3f7e27e12e8ddca92e43b1ff01d58aa/> upgrade dashmap to 5.1.0 (with security fix)
 - <csr-id-c800fdd331e6d7a0b8d756ba822915259f26e9e8/> remove unused dependencies

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d792ea543246632bf1ca8d0e1d239bbe7f07e219/> use enumerations to advertise progress ids publicly.
   Previously these were an implementation detail which also means they
   couldn't be relied upon.
   
   Thanks to an intermediate enumeration, they become part of the public API
   and their actual value is not exposed.
 - <csr-id-f0e40ecddaf1211f76ed60ef30cf03dcfd53a7ab/> add `wasm` feature toggle to allow compilation to wasm32-unknown-unknown
 - <csr-id-a85dcddba29a453bbea87ac865b8aedc97f41aed/> add `data::File::resolve_header()` to obtain object information without decompressing it.
 - <csr-id-c8835c6edae784c9ffcb69a674c0a6545dbb2af3/> upgrade to `prodash 21.1` and add `Ids` to all progress instances.
   That way callers can identify progress they are interested in, say, for
   selective visualizations.
 - <csr-id-450257eb596465352fb363a5c8c514f544e7f9ac/> `Bundle::write…` also produces a `.keep` file
   These files are placed before moving the coresponding pack and index
   files into place to prevent them from being picked up for collection
   while their refs are still being placed.
   
   The caller is responsible for deleting them once refs integrate the
   contained objects into the commit graph.
 - <csr-id-6836cb148cbadf919bdac2e0e77bdec34caa9307/> more efficient distribution of tasks to threads during pack resolution.
   This clearly is a peak-performance optimization as it will now
   efficiently distribut tree-root nodes to threads one at a time by
   means of shared memory, which is accessed mutably yet safely.
   
   This change can also further reduce peak memory usage as it will not
   keep buffers of more resolved deltas then necessary, as it only handles
   one at a time per thread.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-503b1a1f8d4f39b44c166209d7a8ba8d74137859/> `index::File::lookup_prefix(…)`
 - <csr-id-cb83beedd1aa389f6774e2296f79273e8c8f14f4/> git-hash::Prefix::from_id()
   A way to obtain a prefix of an object id, with all non-prefix
   bytes set to zero.
 - <csr-id-16208306ab49ade30d8ffd6b067ebd8eefd84cd4/> in-manifest and in-lib documentation of feature toggles
 - <csr-id-b80dec2323b81fb2172df76c7d897a4b5e6bdfea/> zero-objects check for index and multi-index integrity validation
 - <csr-id-56fc99fb9c1cab61abd03c10e1b4af0d6e491bbf/> support for fan-checking in index and multi-index integrity verification
 - <csr-id-28e3ea8612112f6a04cfaff591565eca5a1ffba2/> introduce type for entry indices within an index or multi-index
   That way it's a littl emore descriptive than a bare u32.
 - <csr-id-58c2edb76755ab71e10eef4cd9a51533825c291f/> git_pack::Find::try_find_cached(…, pack_cache)
   With this method it's easier to bypass local caches and control
   the cache oneself entirely.
 - <csr-id-e25f4eadec679406aad6df10026e27e4832c2482/> A simplified version of the `Find` trait
   It's meant for the next generation of object db handles which keep a
   local cache of all the details of the actual object database.
 - <csr-id-60c9fad8002b4e3f6b9607bba6361871752f4d3d/> control pack and object cache size in megabytes
 - <csr-id-50cf610e8939812c3d2268c48835e2dac67d0c31/> cache::Object trait for caching and retrieving whole objects
 - <csr-id-5a8c2da6cb1e2accf7cfdccc16bc3a1d0b2a7dbc/> object cache size is configurable
 - <csr-id-d6c44e6ab8f436020d4fb235e423b018fd1e7a9f/> dynamically sized full-object speeds up diff-based object counting…
   …which is what happens when counting objects for fetches where only
   changed objects should be sent.

## 0.30.1 (2023-01-10)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.30.0 (2023-01-09)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.29.0 (2022-12-30)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.28.0 (2022-12-19)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-a85dcddba29a453bbea87ac865b8aedc97f41aed/> add `data::File::resolve_header()` to obtain object information without decompressing it.
 - <csr-id-c8835c6edae784c9ffcb69a674c0a6545dbb2af3/> upgrade to `prodash 21.1` and add `Ids` to all progress instances.
   That way callers can identify progress they are interested in, say, for
   selective visualizations.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-37f3a675d7fa931f5d3f38e91df74ec0b517422b/> move `data::ResolveBase` into `data::decode_entry::`; unify `decode_entry|decode_header::Error` into `decode::Error`.

## 0.27.0 (2022-11-21)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

## 0.26.0 (2022-11-08)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.25.0 (2022-11-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-450257eb596465352fb363a5c8c514f544e7f9ac/> `Bundle::write…` also produces a `.keep` file
   These files are placed before moving the corresponding pack and index
   files into place to prevent them from being picked up for collection
   while their refs are still being placed.
   
   The caller is responsible for deleting them once refs integrate the
   contained objects into the commit graph.

## 0.24.0 (2022-10-10)

<csr-id-b46347fd3d50886eeca500e31e1e12b354711309/>
<csr-id-591afd56d9862a6348ef8b3af61798004b36aa19/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6836cb148cbadf919bdac2e0e77bdec34caa9307/> more efficient distribution of tasks to threads during pack resolution.
   This clearly is a peak-performance optimization as it will now
   efficiently distribute tree-root nodes to threads one at a time by
   means of shared memory, which is accessed mutably yet safely.
   
   This change can also further reduce peak memory usage as it will not
   keep buffers of more resolved deltas then necessary, as it only handles
   one at a time per thread.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-ec58bef84d620360dc52e34e173ace1310f74c85/> reduce memory usage for pack resolution by 18%…
   …compared to where it started out before.
   
   This is the result of using u32 instead of usize where possible,
   leveraging the object limit of u32 in packs.
   
   This change makes the biggest difference by not keeping the decompressed
   memory of leaf nodes alive for longer than needed, at the cost of
   some code duplication which could be extracted into a function if one
   was inclined to deal with the boilerplate and lots of generics.
 - <csr-id-49d168a8859c6b5a9e7ef58cd836093212c2c7ad/> Allow verification of empty packs and indices.
   Empty packs are fine, even though the implementation should probably
   assure to not write them, or remove them after having been written.
 - <csr-id-a745512185fb0a46e35daaa6d28829aec05edb55/> increase pack-receive performance using a BufWriter
   Previously the NamedTempFile would receive every little write request
   for millions of objects, consuming considerable amounts of time.
   
   Now a buf writer alleviates this issue entirely.
 - <csr-id-0b6ed60f842f0a36f61f187651080540a358758e/> `bundle::write::Error` is now publicly available

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-5a75afe0467e4a84323ea10172eed835cc7fae4c/> Reading and writing empty packs is explicitly allowed.
   This can happen when sending packs that don't actually contain changes,
   but need to be sent to conform to the protocol.

### Other (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b46347fd3d50886eeca500e31e1e12b354711309/> `index::write::Outcome::index_kind` -> `::index_version`.
 - <csr-id-591afd56d9862a6348ef8b3af61798004b36aa19/> `bundle::write::Options::index_kind` -> `::index_version`.

## 0.23.0 (2022-09-20)

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-e0b8636f96e4bfe1bc72b5aa6ad4c4c8538ff92c/> replace bare u32 `data::Id` typedef

### Other

 - <csr-id-e6ff1a885889cf88f6b34b1193aa03d8bce16af5/> :File uses its hash_len parameter
 - <csr-id-f48630ba8f745c2ec61a1e3c51fa63a1789a088c/> :Find implementation for Rc

### Chore

 - <csr-id-c800fdd331e6d7a0b8d756ba822915259f26e9e8/> remove unused dependencies

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b80dec2323b81fb2172df76c7d897a4b5e6bdfea/> zero-objects check for index and multi-index integrity validation
 - <csr-id-56fc99fb9c1cab61abd03c10e1b4af0d6e491bbf/> support for fan-checking in index and multi-index integrity verification
 - <csr-id-28e3ea8612112f6a04cfaff591565eca5a1ffba2/> introduce type for entry indices within an index or multi-index
   That way it's a little more descriptive than a bare u32.
 - <csr-id-58c2edb76755ab71e10eef4cd9a51533825c291f/> gix_pack::Find::try_find_cached(…, pack_cache)
   With this method it's easier to bypass local caches and control
   the cache oneself entirely.
 - <csr-id-e25f4eadec679406aad6df10026e27e4832c2482/> A simplified version of the `Find` trait
   It's meant for the next generation of object db handles which keep a
   local cache of all the details of the actual object database.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-42e0487286c1f745837c0ce337ed7c9d86b14516/> support Rust 1.52
 - <csr-id-84ade1d23060f10bf6c8529f8f693d06660b4f4e/> Allow resolution of in-pack ref-deltas
   This finally allows delta tree caches to be used on typical small packs
   returned by GitHub.
 - <csr-id-ba92cc09ba41fe4c9a9097bfeb8d18016408fcdf/> don't try to short-cut detection of large offsets when writing index files
   The code incorrectly assumed that the input is sorted by offsets, with
   the largest offset being last, even though by all means that's not the
   case.
 - <csr-id-6d3f52dc13d7243a6bce6dab89a985114a75d94b/> Avoid the dashmap being cloned for each thread
   Instead, share it by reference, it's sync after all.
   
   This issue was introduced when switching to a `Send + Clone` model,
   instead of `Send + Sync`, to allow thread-local caches in database
   handles of all kinds.
 - <csr-id-b605c1fa0494b10872d3c2e6ecce0e39f1a90a9e/> linked::Store now assures unique IDs across compound stores

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-a79a7fb638b45df88af0d0d5fc9ada6d824bc328/> Improve method signatures of `cache::Tree::*`
 - <csr-id-91d047658b114f372735116c9d8e6962a3873137/> cleanup and unify `verify_integrity()` method signature
   Previously they used many different ways of handling their parameters
   despite all boiling down to calling the same 'index::File::traverse()`
   method.
   
   This allows for more reuse of `Options` structs and generally makes
   clearer how these options are used.
 - <csr-id-2cf7727228e1d8094ffd2eec6746006348c39eab/> `index::File::traverse()` now returns an `Outcome` struct instead of tuple of 3 fields
 - <csr-id-bf04644ab75ed1969507f957dc8d4868790d462d/> remove `Option<impl Progress>` in favor of `impl Progress`
 - <csr-id-6829e5e5d6aed1e6c87647144e2dd76a1e4b9f1f/> multi-index integrity check; use `integrity::Outcome` for various integrity checks
 - <csr-id-d851bede97801096d188ff6af06c98a79fe276db/> remove unnecessary `Arc` around `should_interrupt` flag
 - <csr-id-c2679a03358b9c19d63ed1af1cd57324c6381447/> remove Sha1 mentions in `index::verify::Mode::*` variants
   The hash is repository defined and not hard-coded
 - <csr-id-80b120d3278e46429f848df7af3db13413c36649/> introduce `index::File::verify_integrity(…, pack: Option<PackContext>, …)`, replacing tuple
   This allows for more documentation on what input is required there and
   generally makes for an easier to use API.
 - <csr-id-79dc0d5ba6fa31ddd5c075693ffdc6496c1eaded/> rename `oid::try_from()` to `try_from_bytes()`, add `from_bytes_unchecked()`
   This change was done in the name of consistency, as `from_bytes()` is
   used in many other git-* crates
 - <csr-id-2ef9a8424af51310db8c1e6df31dde9953ed3d21/> Change accessors named `hash_kind()` to `object_hash()` for consistency
 - <csr-id-b76f6be6c5baa6cf613a174241f007e92bf5ba36/> consistently use `object_hash` instead of `hash_kind`
 - <csr-id-629412b4cb192614b7eff08dbf203e3448c902c1/> data::Entry::from_read() now takes a hash lengths as parameter
   That way ref-deltas can be interpreted without hard-coding SHA1
 - <csr-id-851dc2c52fa8e204ba2d5ced8fb0959a889869d8/> data::Entry::from_bytes(…, hash_len) takes new parameter
   The hash-len tells it how to interpret ref-delta objects, which
   store the complete hash of the base object.
   
   This is now entirely configurable.
 - <csr-id-db8c8c41b4ced0fc296d3877883d801e77d550ae/> `index::File::at()` with gix_hash::Kind parameter
   It will allow to assume different hashes even in the index file format
   which isn't yet capable of storing this information.
 - <csr-id-e6a3c9f72332b524b143bc94ee9df0a6db11e864/> `data::File::at()` and `Bundle::at()` now have `hash_kind` parameter
   It's used to configure the kind of hash to assume when reading packs and
   indices.
 - <csr-id-3f05fea55dc8acce1ed62ecbe4e0a1394f2720b7/> remove `make_object_cache` parameter from `gix_pack::data::output::count::objects()`
   It now is an implementation detail of the Find trait.
 - <csr-id-82b9b33bd5f4c3c1721a5093de2cedc62cb10565/> move `bundle::Location` to `data::entry::Location`
   The latter place best describes its purpose.
 - remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - move gix_pack::data::Object to gix_object::Data, massively alter gix_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.

## 0.15.0 (2021-11-29)

<csr-id-598698b88c194bc0e6ef69539f9fa7246ebfab70/>

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e7526b2a7b51cbac4018e1ab3b623a85987fadc2/> parallel utilities now use `Send + Clone` instead of `Send + Sync`.
   
   This helps to assure that thread-local computations always work with the
   kind of types we provide. The ones that are carrying out actions are
   notably not `Sync` anymore.
   
   We cater to that by defining our bounds accordingly, but for those
   who want to use other utilities that need Sync, using types like
   `Repository` and `thread_local!()` is the only way to make this
   work.

## 0.14.0 (2021-11-16)

<csr-id-e8b091943f0c9a26317da0003f7fcdf5a56ef21a/>

An important bugfix to prevent assertion failures when writing thin packs.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-20b3994206aa5bc5e35cbbc9c8f8f99187077f79/> Adjust size-hints of resolving entries iterator and use the upper bound in delta tree.
   
   The delta-tree is a data structure that actually heavily relies on
   favorable allocation and a known amount of objects in order to
   provide front and back buffers. However, this is an implementation
   detail and they don't have to stay consistent at all especially
   after growing the buffer by pushing to it.
   
   Interestingly, the VecDeque internally over-allocates as well which
   definitely helps the example of `as_mut_slices()`, otherwise
   it could also suffer from the assertions that trigger here.

## v0.13.0 (2021-10-19)

A maintenance release to properly dealing with previously breaking changes in `gix-hash`.

## v0.12.0 (2021-10-15)

<csr-id-d8fe8141e80a9e9a433b5e1a072b850325c806c8/>
<csr-id-faf6f813927720c5adf62102f9ce46606ff2617c/>

<csr-id-8fe461281842b58aa11437445637c6e587bedd63/>

This release contains bugfixes and features, but is considered breaking as `gix-traverse`
signalled a breaking change which is one of our dependencies.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-71c628d46088ab455b54eb2330d24dcff96c911d/> Use 'cache::Object' trait where it matters
 - <csr-id-8fe461281842b58aa11437445637c6e587bedd63/> split data::output::count::objects into files

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d6c44e6ab8f436020d4fb235e423b018fd1e7a9f/> dynamically sized full-object speeds up diff-based object counting
   which is what happens when counting objects for fetches where only changed objects should be sent.
 - <csr-id-50cf610e8939812c3d2268c48835e2dac67d0c31/> `cache::Object` trait for caching and retrieving whole objects
 - <csr-id-60c9fad8002b4e3f6b9607bba6361871752f4d3d/> control pack and object cache size in megabytes
 - <csr-id-5a8c2da6cb1e2accf7cfdccc16bc3a1d0b2a7dbc/> object cache size is configurable

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d8fe8141e80a9e9a433b5e1a072b850325c806c8/> don't put more objects into the pack cache than needed.
   
   Previously when accessing a packed object, it would store the base
   object into the pack cache (if it wasn't retrieved from there)
   which is great if that operation is free.
   
   Since it isn't, it's better not to stress the cache with puts
   and trash more objects than necessary.
   
   Now only the last decompressed object will be put into the LRU cache.
 - <csr-id-faf6f813927720c5adf62102f9ce46606ff2617c/> don't include submodules in count,
   which avoids dealing with missing objects entirely. Those ominous missing objects where just git submodules after all.
   
   It's still a good idea to handle these gracefully though, git itself
   seems to ignore them, too, and so do we at least for now.

### Performance

 - <csr-id-f9232acf8e52f8cd95520d122469e136eb07b39f/> ObjectID specific hashers, using the fact that object ids are hashes
