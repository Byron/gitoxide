[features]

## Provide a fixed-size allocation-free LRU cache for packs. It's useful if caching is desired while keeping the memory footprint
## for the LRU-cache itself low.
pack-cache-lru-static = ["gix-pack/pack-cache-lru-static"]
## Provide a hash-map based LRU cache whose eviction is based a memory cap calculated from object data.
pack-cache-lru-dynamic = ["gix-pack/pack-cache-lru-dynamic"]
## If set, select algorithms may additionally use a full-object cache which is queried before the pack itself.
object-cache-dynamic = ["gix-pack/object-cache-dynamic"]
## Data structures implement `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize`.
