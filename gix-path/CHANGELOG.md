## 0.10.9 (2024-07-18)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-15235bf7968042da0493d431bbc955d6f9f54188/> Don't assume program files folder locations
   This checks where *program files* directories are located on a
   Windows system, which are used for a fallback check after `git`
   has not been found in a `PATH` search (to invoke `git` to find out
   information such as the location of its system config file).
   
   Previously, two hard-coded paths were used. These were correct for
   the vast majority of 64-bit Windows systems, but were in practice
   never correct on 32-bit Windows systems. Checking programmatically
   for the locations should thus enable detection to succeed on more
   systems and under more circumstances, and avoid other problems.

## 0.10.4 (2024-01-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8d4bf403aecbe16ad2f4083f40c504c6fc4d7eab/> prevent very long path from using unbounded time in `realpath()`.
   It's possible to inject such paths using urls which can then end up
   being canonicalized, causing very long runtimes with excessively long
   paths due to `is_symlink` calls which will be slow.
   
   Now the amount of components is limited to 4096/2, which should be
   a worst-case path at the border of realistic.
   
   If this limitation becomes too arbitrary, one could consider making
   this cut-off value configurable.

## 0.10.3 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.7.4 (2023-04-26)

**YANKED** due to accidental breaking changes.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-1e73f3c319caec0298cdd8c34f29ff78ff4060ab/> add `join_bstr_unix_pathsep(base, component)`.
   It's useful to have to avoid certain conversions to happen otherwise.
 - <csr-id-0d340f4fdeff1576460d43ca2210b11f0641c5dd/> add `xdg_config_home()`, installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix()` functions.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-bd1ae0db32191fb96d6b2a55b9fcb635d1652c1f/> `join_bstr_unix_pathsep()` works more suitably if base path is empty.
 - <csr-id-13edfe96696636c30040ec81ebc4e235ac689429/> use `home` in `env::home_dir()`
 - <csr-id-ec049fec7f789f6b55ca18a691388c44778603d4/> use `home` in `env::home_dir()`.
   This way it should work better on windows as it now uses the home_dir implementation
   of a crate used by `cargo`.

## 0.7.2 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

## 0.7.1 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-37cab07f283a368f323604372c84475d73d6c258/>
<csr-id-54801592488416ef2bb0f34c5061b62189c35c5e/>

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-37cab07f283a368f323604372c84475d73d6c258/> Rename absolutize() to normalize()
  The name absolutize implies strongly that the returned path will be
  absolute, but the function only converts relative paths to absolute under a
  few specific circumstances.

  The new name, normalize(), is inspired by Python's os.path.normpath(),
  Java's java.nio.file.Path.normalize(), Node's Path.normalize(), and maybe
  some others which have similar semantics to this function.
- <csr-id-54801592488416ef2bb0f34c5061b62189c35c5e/> various name changes for more convenient API

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-7dbab1c62c49822983c59be0443478f7b4fecbca/> `absolutize()` now takes a mandatory `current_dir()` parameter and returns `Option<path>`
   Previously the function was willing to return an empty path despite it
   being invalid. With the `current_dir` being required, this won't be the
   case anymore and will yield logically consistent results in all cases.
   
   This forces the caller to deal with the relative path being invalid
   or crafted to produce some other path, maybe to bypass sanity checks.
 - <csr-id-c9933c0b0f51d21dc8244b2acc33d7dc8a33f6ce/> Remove `git-config` test utilities from `git-path`.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-266d4379e9132fd7dd21e6c8fccb36e125069d6e/> Make `realpath()` easier to use by introducing `realpath_opt()`.
   That way there is consistency about how many symlinks to follow.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-dfa1e05d3c983f1e8b1cb3b80d03608341187883/> `realpath()` handles `cwd` internally
   This makes for more convenient usage in the common case.

### Refactor

- <csr-id-8ab47bbdac44c0fa738215d3cc457eb3b6f30504/> rename tests/convert/normalize.rs
  This renames the test module to match the new function name.

### Other

- <csr-id-e4f4c4b2c75a63a40a174e3a006ea64ef8d78809/> :discover()` now returns the shortest path.
  If and only if it canonicalized the source path. That way, users will
  still get a familiar path. This is due to `parent()` not operating
  in the file system, which otherwise would be equivalent to `..`,
  but that's not how we work.

  Maybe we should overhaul the way this works to use `../` instead
  and just 'absoluteize' the path later (std::path::absolute()) is
  on the way for that.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-745d92636f8a3436ded0c9da21beb92182341998/> `.` substitution is only done if the input was relative.
   Previously it was possible to have `/a/b/../b` and a CWD of `/a/b`
   replaced with `.` even though that clearly isn't what the user provided.
   
   Now the `.` resubstitution only happens when it's in the interest
   of the caller.
 - <csr-id-92d5d133e17c6b79400ec57b55ccd5337f3796b7/> `normalize()` would fail to interpret `../` correctly and end up in an invalid path.
   This is now fixed and should never happen again thanks to the addition
   of a missing test.
 - <csr-id-9171adb796b38b08cae9bdd375b16a59a8166a1c/> Handle `.` specifically in `absolutize()`.
   Previously, absolutizing `./../../` would lead to one path component
   of the `../` to be ignored as `.` was popped successfully, not realizing
   that it is a no-op.
   
   This could lead to problems with repository discovery if `.` was passed.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-25e795f4fe858d646ae7a3c4706e14a3837c3e66/> Add `os_string_into_bstring()` as sibling of `os_str_into_bstr()`.
 - <csr-id-523418f69030faa0add6472b14333e9aafc69f56/> add support for `wasi`
   This allows path conversions there to be just as efficient as on unix.
   
   This was adopted from [a PR in the
   hexlix-editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/3890/files#diff-504515b66023120e75a921cd56a932aed76c0ff62593fbb69d92e0ef65089501R47).
 - <csr-id-f58a043273b8e15afd01aac71f33652783baf462/> add `is_absolute()` for git-style absolute checks
   This essentially means that starting slashes are always absolute, even
   on windows.
 - <csr-id-35f146a8573dcc9a1de3230373c0cf0794c6b897/> Add `absolutize_components()`
   It helps to cleanup paths a little which comes in handy when dealing
   with `commondir` appended paths.

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

</details>

## 0.7.0 (2022-12-19)

<csr-id-8ab47bbdac44c0fa738215d3cc457eb3b6f30504/>
<csr-id-37cab07f283a368f323604372c84475d73d6c258/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-25e795f4fe858d646ae7a3c4706e14a3837c3e66/> Add `os_string_into_bstring()` as sibling of `os_str_into_bstr()`.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-745d92636f8a3436ded0c9da21beb92182341998/> `.` substitution is only done if the input was relative.
   Previously it was possible to have `/a/b/../b` and a CWD of `/a/b`
   replaced with `.` even though that clearly isn't what the user provided.
   
   Now the `.` resubstitution only happens when it's in the interest
   of the caller.
 - <csr-id-92d5d133e17c6b79400ec57b55ccd5337f3796b7/> `normalize()` would fail to interpret `../` correctly and end up in an invalid path.
   This is now fixed and should never happen again thanks to the addition
   of a missing test.

### Refactor

- <csr-id-8ab47bbdac44c0fa738215d3cc457eb3b6f30504/> rename tests/convert/normalize.rs
  This renames the test module to match the new function name.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-37cab07f283a368f323604372c84475d73d6c258/> Rename absolutize() to normalize()
  The name absolutize implies strongly that the returned path will be
  absolute, but the function only converts relative paths to absolute under a
  few specific circumstances.

  The new name, normalize(), is inspired by Python's os.path.normpath(),
  Java's java.nio.file.Path.normalize(), Node's Path.normalize(), and maybe
  some others which have similar semantics to this function.

## 0.6.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-7dbab1c62c49822983c59be0443478f7b4fecbca/> `absolutize()` now takes a mandatory `current_dir()` parameter and returns `Option<path>`
   Previously the function was willing to return an empty path despite it
   being invalid. With the `current_dir` being required, this won't be the
   case anymore and will yield logically consistent results in all cases.
   
   This forces the caller to deal with the relative path being invalid
   or crafted to produce some other path, maybe to bypass sanity checks.

## 0.5.0 (2022-09-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-523418f69030faa0add6472b14333e9aafc69f56/> add support for `wasi`
   This allows path conversions there to be just as efficient as on unix.
   
   This was adopted from [a PR in the
   hexlix-editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/3890/files#diff-504515b66023120e75a921cd56a932aed76c0ff62593fbb69d92e0ef65089501R47).

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

## 0.4.2 (2022-08-29)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f58a043273b8e15afd01aac71f33652783baf462/> add `is_absolute()` for git-style absolute checks
   This essentially means that starting slashes are always absolute, even
   on windows.

## 0.4.1 (2022-08-23)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9171adb796b38b08cae9bdd375b16a59a8166a1c/> Handle `.` specifically in `absolutize()`.
   Previously, absolutizing `./../../` would lead to one path component
   of the `../` to be ignored as `.` was popped successfully, not realizing
   that it is a no-op.
   
   This could lead to problems with repository discovery if `.` was passed.

## 0.4.0 (2022-07-22)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dfa1e05d3c983f1e8b1cb3b80d03608341187883/> `realpath()` handles `cwd` internally
   This makes for more convenient usage in the common case.

## 0.3.0 (2022-06-19)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c9933c0b0f51d21dc8244b2acc33d7dc8a33f6ce/> Remove `gix-config` test utilities from `gix-path`.

## 0.2.0 (2022-06-13)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-266d4379e9132fd7dd21e6c8fccb36e125069d6e/> Make `realpath()` easier to use by introducing `realpath_opt()`.
   That way there is consistency about how many symlinks to follow.

## 0.1.3 (2022-05-23)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.1.2 (2022-05-21)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.1.1 (2022-05-18)

<csr-id-e4f4c4b2c75a63a40a174e3a006ea64ef8d78809/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-35f146a8573dcc9a1de3230373c0cf0794c6b897/> Add `absolutize_components()`
   It helps to cleanup paths a little which comes in handy when dealing
   with `commondir` appended paths.

### Other

- <csr-id-e4f4c4b2c75a63a40a174e3a006ea64ef8d78809/> :discover()` now returns the shortest path.
  If and only if it canonicalized the source path. That way, users will
  still get a familiar path. This is due to `parent()` not operating
  in the file system, which otherwise would be equivalent to `..`,
  but that's not how we work.

  Maybe we should overhaul the way this works to use `../` instead
  and just 'absolutize' the path later (std::path::absolute()) is
  on the way for that.

## 0.1.0 (2022-04-28)

<csr-id-54801592488416ef2bb0f34c5061b62189c35c5e/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-54801592488416ef2bb0f34c5061b62189c35c5e/> various name changes for more convenient API

## 0.0.0 (2022-03-31)

An empty crate without any content to reserve the name for the gitoxide project.
