 - <csr-id-cf51a4de2d06eb28435ef8e386131710003b6928/> `gix rev parse --format` to provide different versions of the same content.
   This only applies to blobs, but allows to obtain different versions of the same blob
   like:
   
   * what's stored in Git
* what would be checked out to the worktree
* what would be diffed

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-b2300782ad09f17730fe2a5ba4938517d4e7ec16/> in `--trace` mode, greatly increase message-buffer size.
   That way, it's much less likely that messages will get lost
   due to being overwritten before they can be displayed every
   100ms or so.
 - <csr-id-eab22bd5d56bf91ee0edfc7156023c159c7f65f9/> set binary name for completions

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2189cee47f99350b368390eaa2a01961bb77c250/> rename `GITOXIDE_*` environment variables to `GIX_#`

    - Improve documentation slightly ([`b7c9275`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/b7c92753f52e71f118b6e21ab672ae56961306c5))

## 0.31.0 (2023-10-12)

This release includes an overhaul of the url parsing implementation, allowing more urls to be parsed correctly and refining the error messages for
invalid ones. Improvements include the added support for ssh aliases (`github:byron/gitoxide` has previously been parsed as local path), adjustments
around the interpretation of colons in file names (previously we disallowed colons that were not followed up with a slash character) and some smaller
changes that bring the interpretation of file urls more in line with Git's implementation.

There are still many (edge) cases in Git's url parsing implementation which are not handled correctly by Gitoxide. If you notice any such deviation please
open a new issue to help us making Gitoxide even more correct.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-70923a0fad3d409069bd9d0b492e6a9b7b113261/> add shell completions for bash
 - <csr-id-46e591914d548bacae2656ffe14a0ea7ca2eb7ae/> `gix status` auto-writes changed indices.
   This prevents expensive operations to re-occour.
 - <csr-id-7ba2fa1c7781230913b0a04ad8684fa7d0143c18/> `gix status -s/--statistics` to obtain additional information on what happened.
   This is useful for understanding performance characteristics in detail.

## 0.30.0 (2023-09-24)

<csr-id-d3ac691446c9d029eb4f04d111887fa06720939d/>
<csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/>

This release contains a security fix which assure URLs like `'ssh://-oProxyCommand=open$IFS-aCalculator/foo'` will not execute attacker-controlled
strings. The above can, on MacOS, launch the calculator app when using it with `gix clone` for example, up to v0.29.0.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f094f71dc1a50955552509d108556c01517c6ed6/> `gix status` with basic index-worktree comparison
 - <csr-id-3ff5ac0cda9e3e089dc79fdfbff5ff619ee60b1f/> `gix free index from-list` and `gix index from-tree` gain `--skip-hash`.
   This flag can be derived from options, but thus far we have no higher-level
   writing of the index so this has to do to see the difference in performance.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-d3ac691446c9d029eb4f04d111887fa06720939d/> both `ein` and `gix` now share some code via the `gitoxide` library.
   This can slightly improve compile times as well, even though it wasn't measured.

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/> update to the latest `prodash`
   It makes proper usage of `Progress` types easier and allows them to be used
   as `dyn` traits as well.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

### Commit Statistics

 - 13 commits contributed to the release over the course of 27 calendar days.
 - 33 days passed between releases.

## 0.27.0 (2023-06-22)

<csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/>

This release fixes a possibility for V1 fetches to deadlock if negotiation would span multiple rounds 
(see issue [#882](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/issues/882)) for details.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b82edc8b965344a866039f6c99295db4f8e776e2/> list commit-graph entries by graph traversal, move commit-graph up to `gix` level.
   This is merely a debug tool to learn about generation numbers.
   All commit-graph commands now operate on a repository.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c494cfd6f80cf273107c626d0f2cbe054db378ee/> `gix --trace` to also print tree-like instrumentation
 - <csr-id-452ed6b79ed0e12ae214af3c8cd49a87dba91c73/> `gix fetch --open-negotiation-graph[=limit]`
   Open the negotiation graph as SVG, after optionally specifying a limit
   as rendering/layouting can be very slow.
   
   It's useful to see how the negotiation algorithm is reasoning about each commit.
 - <csr-id-096838ffa529148b2da3a2382a2d1fdbfe5bee5b/> `gix fetch --negotiation-info` to provide additional information about the negotiation phase.
 - <csr-id-bd32e393fedd01e27a4f6984281bcc3182c63b67/> `bit revision list --svg` to create a visual graph of commits.
   It's mainly a test of how well `layout-rs` performs.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/> Add `clippy::redundant-closure-for-method-calls` lint

### Commit Statistics

## 0.26.0 (2023-06-07)

The main attraction of this release is support for multi-round negotiations thanks to support for the standard negotiations algorithms.
Further, `gix index entries` now lists attributes as well, and there is the new `gix attribute query` sub-command in the vain of `git check-attrs`.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e1fcc7f69e7b95aeac8cbbde3719a1e6b9dafeba/> `gix attributes validate` to validate attributes and ignore against `git` as baseline.
   Use this command to test the entire index for ignored paths and their attributes and use
   `git check-attr` and `git check-ignore` to validate that `git` agrees. Collect all
   mismatches and print them.
 - <csr-id-450b2325909459c7061f3d02f461c3f0f20f1e86/> `--statistics` for `gix excludes query`
   With it one gets some insights into the work done to fulfil the query.
 - <csr-id-bfdcb147cdc3d0338a4cd2bc915b0e0eeced1e99/> `gix attribute query` as something similar to `git check-attrs`.
 - <csr-id-b8db2072bb6a5625f37debe9e58d08461ece67dd/> `no-repo index from-list` to create an index with empty files from the given list.
   The list could be created with `find . -type f` for example.
 - <csr-id-13a0f1e568cf9ee462ecf01d416cfcd4949fd9c6/> add pro-forma library to allow feature documentation of `gitoxide` on docs.rs

## 0.25.0 (2023-04-27)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes, just to fix installation

## 0.24.0 (2023-04-27)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-08e8fc2152794652ba1c986df493c2ac915af9e7/> `gix index entries` also prints attributes.
 - <csr-id-9723e1addf52cc336d59322de039ea0537cdca36/> `gix clone` and `gix fetch` with controls for shallow repositories.
 - <csr-id-f93e964b1f7ba95861966ce58ebef477013dd1b4/> `ein t trace-path` know accepts the `trace-file` alias.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-dd14a80a78fea3f092b1d5300637c80cfd9e59a7/> printing to stdout for commands that don't show progress is greatly improved.
   Previously it would have to lock `stdout` on each write, now this is done only once.
 - <csr-id-7bd8823ab4241d6d0401f03aec8c0d34f68c347c/> opening repositories without 'strict' mode also ignores IO errors.
   These will instead be logged, but won't make it impossible to open an
   otherwise fine repository.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ca8ebdfb9647ff15b0293823bb3bb3c6779c8dd2/> turn `gix free index entries` into `gix index entries`.

## 0.23.0 (2023-02-24)

This release adds the new `ein tool query` analytics engine, which maintains a database of a git repository as acceleration data structure to run useful queries on.
It's nothing more than an MVP, and was inspired by a program to accelerate [Git-Heat-Map](https://github.com/jmforsythe/Git-Heat-Map/pull/6).

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f8cc62376bd6e940be4c41e84ccbfce111e64e39/> `ein tool query` - a git analytics engine.
   A tool to build and efficiently maintain a database of information contained
   in a git repository, preferably the kind of information that is expensive to obtain,
   in order to facilitate queries that would be prohibitive without an accelerating
   data structure.
 - <csr-id-49520d1f03ee1d011f6e9f2eb07084d327fe95ae/> `gix tree entries` with rev-spec support.
   Previously it wanted a tree-id, now it can derive it itself.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-73372d0bcdca8cf201f057ebee8d67a8e4752625/> re-enable local-time support for all binaries
   The `time` improved the way one can opt-in to potential unsoundness
   in their local time support, forcing the application to make that
   decision at runtime.

## 0.20.0 (2022-12-22)

This release also fixes compatibility issues that formerly prevented to fetch or clone form `https://googlesource.com`.

### Changed

 - <csr-id-a4ac9cf3e667a3059e33aac8188150529578622d/> represent `GIT_(COMMITTER|AUTHOR)_(NAME|EMAIL|DATE)` with git configuration.
   That way it becomes more obvious where values are coming from.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-98143699bb9481b010e21647f64dcb8a74bd80ad/> auto-enabled verbosity for `gix fetch/clone` and add `--no-verbose`.
   I found myself always adding (and having to remember to add) the `-v` flag
   for long-running operations so these should be able to default to a
   higher verbosity level.
   
   To counter that, there is a new `--no-verbose` flag to turn that off.
 - <csr-id-aeb4a1d5cb76316058c7d687e26f5c7db351c09c/> add `--strict` option to enforce strict checking of configuration.
 - <csr-id-8c9c243fc574dc17b92a8e2025fbd8efdf2833da/> `gix odb stats` to calculate statistics on the object database.
   This includes the amount of objects along with a listing of where they are
   located.
 - <csr-id-e2b8c5dce7185b5fa194b90f32e642e5c9d1227f/> `gix clone --no-tags` support.
   This is the same as `git clone --no-tags`.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-49f39d6bb487c0254176a5082f2c7851b83952a1/> `open::ReplacementObjects` is removed in favor of two custom git-configuration flags.
   Now it's possible to map the environment variables `GIT_REPLACE_REF_BASE` and `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS`
   to custom git configuration keys which can also be set, namely `gitoxide.odb.replaceObjectsRefBase`
   and `gitoxide.odb.noReplaceObjects`.
   
   Along with the possibility of disabling the usage of `GIT_` prefixed environment variables one
   reaches the previous level of control without making object replacement a special case.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-becbd8d896a1663f1607be4e86e632773e926f1f/> represent object cache configuration like `GITOXIDE_PACK_CACHE_MEMORY` in git-configuration.
   That way there is a unified system for how to set values, which may be overridable by configuration
   variables or not.
   
   With this changes, the explicit application of environment variables for setting the cache
   isn't required anymore as everything happens using git-configuration, and automatically,
   while providing full control like before.

## 0.17.0 (2022-11-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e973dfeaf17ca63385496202e9fdcdd912e20f42/> `gix remote ref-map --show-unmapped-remote-refs`.
   That way it's more obvious to see what was filtered out by ref-specs.
   
   It's also great to validate that server-side filtering via ref-prefix
   will not send refs that are referred to by symbolic refs that are
   not filtered out. That should be fine as it's all about objects,
   it's just something to deal with as we may have to deal with symbolic
   refs that aren't in the set of refs the server sent to us.
 - <csr-id-b1edb9e3537df86669714f03666f4a88e0ac3709/> diff algorithm is controlled by git configuration `diff.algorithm`
 - <csr-id-20259da4ddf9fabfb2d2bd4e2274c0ed42bdb0e5/> `ein t hours` allows to specify the amount of worker threads.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-3a053284cfefe27873dcc5b4f74d63a560bb5d41/> collect `stderr` and print it afterwards to avoid intersection with line progress.
   Previously it would happen that stderr would be printed directly and mix
   with the line progress (as in `-v`) which also prints to stderr.
   
   Now errors are collected and output at the end once the line renderer
   was already shutdown.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3a0fb1b45c757add49677450836c0aaf6179a2b5/> remote `lock_mode` from all methods dealing with reference edits.
   It is now read from `core.filesRefLockTimeout` accordingly.

## 0.16.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed

 - <csr-id-3c7c9a735f5771ef787cbc86b46cbafc9226f4d6/> `ein tool hours -s` was split into `-f|--file-stats` and `-l|line-stats`.
   That way more information is generated at increasingly high costs.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-28c4cae70aab2bd5b479961fcc6ee91ff80f651b/> `ein tool hours --stat` to collect additional statistics per author.
   Note that these are expensive and unconditionally use threads to speed
   up these computations.
 - <csr-id-5d0332f51c63c5456a28c8f3f466ad805b2e0626/> `ein tool hours -b` ignores bots.
   For now it only considers bots with names containing `[bot]`.

## 0.15.0 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### New Features

 - <csr-id-45a30f0f31a99cda5cf105408e9c3905f43071f2/> Support for `-c/--config` in `gix`
 - <csr-id-5d6d5ca305615568dfedbcc10ea86294c0a0472d/> `gix remote refs` to list all remote references of a suitable remote.
   This takes into account either a named remote, or the remote associated
   with the current branch, or the default remote it could deduce or obtain
   from the configuration.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dda995790c260131048484a11e66185b9c841311/> remove `gix free remote ref-list` in favor of `gix remote refs`
   The functionality is the same, but the latter is built on top of a
   repository which is slightly less flexible, but preferable over
   maintaining a non-repo version.

## 0.14.0 (2022-08-17)

### Changed

 - <csr-id-0235111a4fcc40c7b57d973bfce27a66eddea901/> Invert behaviour to `open::Options::strict_config()`, with lenient being the default.
   This means API users will get libgit2 behaviour but commands like `gix` can
   change options to emulate `git` behaviour.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b83f6bdf7f8d8f5cef2a57fa3932b6a0e0988db1/> `--cat-file` flag for `gix rev parse` to cat instead of resolving.
 - <csr-id-e972aad020d3653a53b20fa6e535d5759e239a45/> `gix rev previous-branches` subcommand

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-edf73dd4db5b0f5d9309c95bf366e11ea6723885/> `ein tools` to `ein tool` for as it's more intuitive

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c5846e05aa54f0601ac7b8e2e59bcf1ffaa305f1/> `gix rev resolve --explain`

 * **[#298](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/issues/298)**
    - Use all tags by default, instead of requiring annotated tags ([`00c42ca`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/00c42ca36e93a22f233fc1d3f9a1afc241fd4464))
    - Support for the --max-candidates flag ([`b9e6754`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/b9e67540801f2630be8aa1acbfddfec4202360ac))

## 0.11.0 (2022-04-03)

<csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/>

Adapt to changes in `gix-features` which change `Send + Sync` to `Send + Clone`. This happens to allow non-sync implementations (i.e. thread-local), along with `Sync` ones
which usually are `Clone` too as they are passed by immutable reference (which is `Clone + Copy`).

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/> Remove light* features, add 'lean-async' in its place; remove termion support

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bf04644ab75ed1969507f957dc8d4868790d462d/> remove `Option<impl Progress>` in favor of `impl Progress`
 - <csr-id-d851bede97801096d188ff6af06c98a79fe276db/> remove unnecessary `Arc` around `should_interrupt` flag
 - <csr-id-c2679a03358b9c19d63ed1af1cd57324c6381447/> remove Sha1 mentions in `index::verify::Mode::*` variants
   The hash is repository defined and not hard-coded
 - <csr-id-51bf03feaa94bebb26690dff92262b2134070a44/> Remove lean plumbing CLI

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-57ca0456cf02073099bfd403f9155290af756ecd/> Collect all stdout messages in line renderer as well
   Otherwise the threaded line renderer will interfere with genuine
   program output.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-384ed665c7423feca1b1ee1f81db10867fa813a8/> `gix mailmap verify` command
 - <csr-id-70109bee679d33a5c5fb3a78a708b479684b03b1/> `ein find --debug` to learn why it is slow
 - <csr-id-00909619ff04e247aabc9ffe3c025f0064c3092d/> --counting-threads flag to configure amount of threads when counting
   The efficiency of multi-threaded counting is low per core, and despite
   some speedups might be desirable, one might not want to commit all cores
   to this amount of waste.
 - <csr-id-25da30f3652bd72c157e84439dd6e3957471fa08/> in-manifest and in-bin documentation of feature toggles
   Unfortunately, these don't show up on docs.rs due to it being a binary
   only crate. One could consider throwing in a lib just for good measure.

## v0.10.0 (2021-10-20)

This release pins beta versions of `clap` to avoid it to automatically fetch the latest one
during installation.

This is made possible due to `clap` itself pinning its dependency
to the `clap-derive` crate.

## v0.9.0 (2021-10-15)

A first usable version of `gix` to make using `gitoxide` from your applications so much easier. It serves as a one-stop shop for application developers without sacrificing performance by default while making common use-cases more convenient.

### Feature list

* `gix` as hub crate for application development with focus on usability without sacrificing any knob to tune performance.
* opt-in `async` for `gix-packetline`, `gix-transport` and `gix-protocol` for fully async git clients, along with the `light-async` feature toggle to build a `gix pack-receive` with an async client instead of a blocking one.
* Statistics for `gix pack-create` with the `-s/--statistics` flag to have data indicating the cost of the operation. Currently it's doing a lot of work that has to be avoided in order to be useable in production and the numbers underline that. Future iterations will cause key metrics to go down.
* Packs are now reproducible by default, which means that the same tip will always generate a pack with the same hash. This may be a desirable property for some kinds of packs, but not for others which is why it can be turned off for a considerable speed boost.
* `gix-tempfile` crate
* `gix-lock` crate
* `gix-ref` crate with complete loose-ref, packed-ref and transaction support.


### Performance

* On M1, thanks to [a new release](https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes/pull/289#event-5035369215), Sha1 is now computed much faster which unlocks a massive performance boost. In my test, verifying/decoding the entire linux kernel pack now happens in 17s, as compared to 37s for canonical `git`.
* `gix-object` parsing is a few percent faster thanks a reworked error handling for objects. By default, error collection is disabled entirely making the error case zero-sized. If needed, verbose and stacked errors can be turned on using a feature toggle for applications who expect repositories with malformed objects and need detailed diagnostics.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-60c9fad8002b4e3f6b9607bba6361871752f4d3d/> control pack and object cache size in megabytes in some sub-commands

### Thanks Clippy

<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>

[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) helped 3 times to make code idiomatic. 

## v0.6.0 (2020-12-16)

Maintenance release without any new features.

These are created to account for breaking changes within the dependency graph of
`gitoxide` crates. Due to some blunders in the past the version on crates.io
could not be installed anymore.
This was eventually fixed with new minor releases across the ecosystem.

Finally, yet another breaking change due to the introduction of the `gix-hash`
crate to break a dependency cycle between `gix-object` and `gix-features` caused
yet another maintenance release.

## v0.5.0 (2020-12-15)

Maintenance release without any new features.
