 * **[#222](https://github.com//Byron/gitoxide/issues/222)**
    - update changelogs prior to release ([`9a493d0`](https://github.com//Byron/gitoxide/commit/9a493d0651b0b6d71cf230dc510a658be7f8cb19))

## v0.11.0 (2021-10-15)

### Dependency Upgrade (BREAKING)

* `git-traverse` saw a breaking change moving to v0.9, which triggered this crate to signal a breaking change, too.

### Type Change (BREAKING)

* `read_line(…)` now strongly types `ERR` packet lines using the new `read::Error`
   type instead of transforming it into a string-error.
   This makes it easier to retrieve the exact error message from the
   returned `std::io::Error` which is useful for presentation to the user.
