## 0.2.0 (2023-06-06)

<csr-id-1571528f8779330aa1d077b1452aa00d9b419033/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-1bd93bedd2f184510239c50c345d3dbc41d7d13b/> allow graph sharing by unifying `Flags` type.
   This makes the graph used in `gix-negotiate` shareable by callers, which can
   do their own traversal and store their own flags. The knowlege of this traversal
   can be kept using such shared flags, like the `PARSED` bit which should be set whenever
   parents are traversed.
   
   That way we are able to emulate the algorithms git uses perfectly, as we keep exactly the
   same state.
 - <csr-id-4aad40d6b6ddee0bc01b222cc2426c61c61d0b1a/> implement `skipping` negotiation algorithm
 - <csr-id-01aba9e92941240eefa898890f1b8b8d824db509/> implement `consecutive` algorithm.
   This is the default negotiation algorithm.
 - <csr-id-1f6e6d8aeb512b2afcd1911cf32e4f7e622bf73d/> introduce the `noop` negotiator to establish a basic trait for negotiators.

### Other

 - <csr-id-1571528f8779330aa1d077b1452aa00d9b419033/> try to change test-suite from --negotiate-only to the more realistic fetch with --dry-run.
   This means we will have to reproduce what git does naturally, to fill in common refs
   and also provide tips.
   
   Unfortunately this doesn't work as it's apparently not really dry-running, but modifying
   the repository underneath. This means it's not idempotent when running it multiple times.
