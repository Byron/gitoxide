## 0.13.0 (2023-08-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c51c8daee1ab54130ae3ed83ce67d08f01c4881a/> fix incorrect s/git-config/gix-config/
   3a861c8f049f6502d3bcbdac752659aa1aeda46a just blindly replaced any
   occurence of "git-config" or "git_config" with "gix-config"/"gix_config".
   
   There is no such thing as a gix-config file.
   gix-config is a git-config file parser.

## 0.11.0 (2023-04-26)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

## 0.10.2 (2023-03-30)

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-02c4659984fa6423bc76cc4980a143edaba8ace0/> fix minor typos

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

## 0.10.1 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-4ebe2ac05dc8bef3bc1783afca3fcfdc565c2aae/>

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

### Other

 - <csr-id-4ebe2ac05dc8bef3bc1783afca3fcfdc565c2aae/> Actively discourage using `Boolean::try_from("")` explicitly.
   Use `config.boolean(…)` instead.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-38b92ba9615f9c90cfeed5bd050007168fa6df94/> build error on Android

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3577aefc68d9aec149e0a0f4192f06d6de9ff531/> `Default` implementation for `Boolean` and `Integer`
 - <csr-id-5f675d387e52a75ff7bd17a38516ce9778ea6b7e/> `Boolean::try_from(OsString)`
   This makes getting booleans from the environment easier.

### Changed

 - <csr-id-5ad296577d837b0699b4718fa2be3d0978c4e342/> `git-config` now uses `git-config-value`.

### Documentation

</details>

## 0.10.0 (2022-12-19)

<csr-id-4ebe2ac05dc8bef3bc1783afca3fcfdc565c2aae/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-4ebe2ac05dc8bef3bc1783afca3fcfdc565c2aae/> Actively discourage using `Boolean::try_from("")` explicitly.
   Use `config.boolean(…)` instead.

## 0.9.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.8.2 (2022-11-17)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3577aefc68d9aec149e0a0f4192f06d6de9ff531/> `Default` implementation for `Boolean` and `Integer`

## 0.8.1 (2022-11-06)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-38b92ba9615f9c90cfeed5bd050007168fa6df94/> build error on Android

## 0.8.0 (2022-09-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-5f675d387e52a75ff7bd17a38516ce9778ea6b7e/> `Boolean::try_from(OsString)`
   This makes getting booleans from the environment easier.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

## v0.7.0 (2022-08-29)

### Changed

 - <csr-id-5ad296577d837b0699b4718fa2be3d0978c4e342/> `gix-config` now uses `gix-config-value`.
