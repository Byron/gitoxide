//! The implementation of creating an archive from a worktree stream, similar to `git archive`.
//!
//! ## Deviation
//!
//! This implementation is early and just does the basics. Git does more to support more context when filtering and to keep
//! more information about entries in the various archive formats.
//! `tar` is implemented in a very basic fashion only.
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//! All features are related to which container formats are available.
