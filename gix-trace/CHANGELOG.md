## 0.1.2 (2023-06-29)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-d5eba46afeaadb9ff113421bdb43466d67cfeac6/> Support for events (e.g. warn!()) via macro.
   Thanks to these, one can now emit warnings which could be visible
   if the application compiled in support for it.
   
   This is a nice alternative compared to having to have a `progress` around.
 - <csr-id-ba777f3978e5c7f0275ad48a54d85ec63609aead/> panic on `record()` if field wasn't found.
   Even though this is a breaking change, it happens at runtime and should be helpful.

## v0.1.0 (2023-06-16)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-093efafa7c39aa03bfef4894779cca6e3716f471/> add `tracing` feature toggle to provide minimal tracing API
   This API is based on `tracing-core`, not on tracing, and provides a limited
   API that is always available, while being a no-op if `tracing` isn't enabled.
   
   That way, plumbing crates can add instrumentation at will.
