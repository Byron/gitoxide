[features]

## Note that there is no default feature, as the application is supposed to opt-in via `gix-features` or using this crate directly.
default = []

## Implement `tracing` with `tracing-core`, which provides applications with valuable performance details if they opt-in to it.
##
## Note that this may have overhead as well, thus instrumentations should be used stategically, only providing coarse tracing by default and adding details
## only where needed while marking them with the appropriate level.
tracing = [ "dep:tracing-core" ]

## If enabled, detailed tracing is also emitted, which can greatly increase insights but at a cost.
