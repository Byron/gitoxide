[features]

default = ["max-performance-safe", "comfort", "basic", "extras"]

#! There are various categories of features which help to optimize performance and build times. `gix` comes with 'batteries included' and everything is
#! enabled as long as it doesn't sacrifice compatibility. Most users will be fine with that but will pay with higher compile times than necessary as they
#! probably don't use all of these features.
#!
#! **Thus it's recommended to take a moment and optimize build times by chosing only those 'Components' that you require.** *'Performance' relevant features should
#! be chosen next to maximize efficiency.*
#!
#! #### Application Developers
#!
#! These are considered the end-users, all they need to tune is `Performance` features to optimize the efficiency of their app, assuming they don't use `gix`
#! directly. Otherwise, see the `Library Developers` paragraph.
#!
#! In order to configure a crate that isn't a direct dependency, one has to make it a direct dependency. We recommend
#! `gix-for-configuration = { package = "gix", version = "X.Y.Z", features = […] }` to make clear this dependency isn't used in code.
#!
#! #### Library Developers
#!
#! As a developer of a library, you should start out with `gix = { version = "X.Y.Z", default-features = false }` and add components as you see fit.
#! For best compatibility, **do not activate `max-performance-safe`** or any other performance options.
#!
#! #### Bundles
#!
#! A bundle is a set of related feature toggles which can be activated with a single name that acts as a group.
#! Bundles are for convenience only and bear no further meaning beyond the cargo manifest file.

## More fundamental components that most will be able to make good use of.
basic = ["blob-diff", "revision", "index"]

## Various additional features and capabilities that are not necessarily part of what most users would need.
extras = ["worktree-stream", "worktree-archive", "revparse-regex", "mailmap", "excludes", "attributes", "worktree-mutation", "credentials", "interrupt", "status"]

## Various progress-related features that improve the look of progress message units.
comfort = ["gix-features/progress-unit-bytes", "gix-features/progress-unit-human-numbers"]

#! #### Components
#!
#! A component is a distinct feature which may be comprised of one or more methods around a particular topic.
#! Providers of libraries should only activate the components they need.

## Obtain information similar to `git status`.
status = ["gix-status"]

## Utilities for interrupting computations and cleaning up tempfiles.
interrupt = ["dep:signal-hook", "gix-tempfile/signals"]

## Access to `.git/index` files.
index = ["dep:gix-index"]

## Access to credential helpers, which provide credentials for URLs.
# Note that `gix-negotiate` just piggibacks here, as 'credentials' is equivalent to 'fetch & push' right now.
credentials = ["dep:gix-credentials", "dep:gix-prompt", "dep:gix-negotiate"]

## Various ways to alter the worktree makeup by checkout and reset.
worktree-mutation = ["attributes", "dep:gix-worktree-state"]

## Retrieve a worktree stack for querying exclude information
excludes = ["dep:gix-ignore", "dep:gix-worktree", "index"]

## Query attributes and excludes. Enables access to pathspecs, worktree checkouts, filter-pipelines and submodules.
attributes = ["excludes", "dep:gix-filter", "dep:gix-pathspec", "dep:gix-attributes", "dep:gix-submodule", "gix-worktree?/attributes"]

## Add support for mailmaps, as way of determining the final name of commmiters and authors.
mailmap = ["dep:gix-mailmap"]

## Make revspec parsing possible, as well describing revision.
revision = ["gix-revision/describe", "index"]

## If enabled, revspecs now support the regex syntax like `@^{/^.*x}`. Otherwise, only substring search is supported.
## This feature does increase compile time for niche-benefit, but is required for fully git-compatible revspec parsing.
revparse-regex = ["regex", "revision"]

## Make it possible to diff blobs line by line. Note that this feature is integral for implementing tree-diffs as well due to the handling of rename-tracking,
## which relies on line-by-line diffs in some cases.
blob-diff = ["gix-diff/blob"]

## Make it possible to turn a tree into a stream of bytes, which can be decoded to entries and turned into various other formats.
worktree-stream = ["gix-worktree-stream", "attributes"]

## Create archives from a tree in the repository, similar to what `git archive` does.
##
## Note that we disable all default features which strips it off all container support, like `tar` and `zip`.
## Your application should add it as dependency and re-activate the desired features.
worktree-archive = ["gix-archive", "worktree-stream", "attributes"]

#! #### Mutually Exclusive Network Client
#!
#! Either `async-*` or `blocking-*` versions of these toggles may be enabled at a time.
#! For this reason, these must be chosen by the user of the library and can't be pre-selected.
#! Making a choice here also affects which crypto-library ends up being used.

## Make `gix-protocol` available along with an async client.
async-network-client = ["gix-protocol/async-client", "gix-pack/streaming-input", "attributes", "credentials"]
## Use this if your crate uses `async-std` as runtime, and enable basic runtime integration when connecting to remote servers via the `git://` protocol.
async-network-client-async-std = ["async-std", "async-network-client", "gix-transport/async-std"]
## Make `gix-protocol` available along with a blocking client, providing access to the `file://`, git://` and `ssh://` transports.
blocking-network-client = ["gix-protocol/blocking-client", "gix-pack/streaming-input", "attributes", "credentials"]
## Stacks with `blocking-network-client` to provide support for HTTP/S using **curl**, and implies blocking networking as a whole, making the `https://` transport avaialble.
blocking-http-transport-curl = ["blocking-network-client", "gix-transport/http-client-curl"]
## Stacks with `blocking-http-transport-curl` and also enables the `rustls` backend to avoid `openssl`.
blocking-http-transport-curl-rustls = ["blocking-http-transport-curl", "dep:curl-for-configuration-only", "curl-for-configuration-only?/rustls"]
## Stacks with `blocking-network-client` to provide support for HTTP/S using **reqwest**, and implies blocking networking as a whole, making the `https://` transport avaialble.
blocking-http-transport-reqwest = ["blocking-network-client", "gix-transport/http-client-reqwest"]
## Stacks with `blocking-http-transport-reqwest` and enables `https://` via the `rustls` crate. Enables `trust-dns` on `reqwest`.
blocking-http-transport-reqwest-rust-tls = ["blocking-http-transport-reqwest", "reqwest-for-configuration-only/rustls-tls", "reqwest-for-configuration-only/trust-dns"]
## Stacks with `blocking-http-transport-reqwest` and enables `https://` via the `rustls` crate. 
blocking-http-transport-reqwest-rust-tls-no-trust-dns = ["blocking-http-transport-reqwest", "reqwest-for-configuration-only/rustls-tls"]
## Stacks with `blocking-http-transport-reqwest` and enables `https://` via the `native-tls` crate.
blocking-http-transport-reqwest-native-tls = ["blocking-http-transport-reqwest", "reqwest-for-configuration-only/default-tls" ]


#! #### Performance
#!
#! The reason these features exist is to allow optimization for compile time and optimize for compatibility by default. This means that some performance options around
#! SHA1 and ZIP might not compile on all platforms, so it depeneds on the end-user who compiles the application to chose these based on their needs.

## Activate features that maximize performance, like usage of threads, `zlib-ng` and access to caching in object databases, skipping the ones known to cause compile failures
## on some platforms.
max-performance-safe = [
    "parallel",
    "pack-cache-lru-static",
    "pack-cache-lru-dynamic",
    "gix-features/fs-walkdir-parallel"
]

## The tempfile registry uses a better implementation of a thread-safe hashmap, relying on an external crate.
## This may be useful when tempfiles are created and accessed in a massively parallel fashion and you know that this is indeed faster than
## the simpler implementation that is the default.
hp-tempfile-registry = ["gix-tempfile/hp-hashmap"]

## Make certain data structure threadsafe (or `Sync`) to facilitate multithreading. Further, many algorithms will now use multiple threads by default.
##
## If unset, most of `gix` can only be used in a single thread as data structures won't be `Send` anymore.
parallel = ["gix-features/parallel"]

## Provide a fixed-size allocation-free LRU cache for packs. It's useful if caching is desired while keeping the memory footprint
## for the LRU-cache itself low.
pack-cache-lru-static = ["gix-pack/pack-cache-lru-static"]

## Provide a hash-map based LRU cache whose eviction is based a memory cap calculated from object data.
pack-cache-lru-dynamic = ["gix-pack/pack-cache-lru-dynamic"]

## Activate other features that maximize performance, like usage of threads, `zlib-ng` and access to caching in object databases.
## Note that some platforms might suffer from compile failures, which is when `max-performance-safe` should be used.
max-performance = [ "max-performance-safe", "gix-features/zlib-ng", "fast-sha1" ]

## If enabled, use assembly versions of sha1 on supported platforms.
## This might cause compile failures as well which is why it can be turned off separately.
fast-sha1 = [ "gix-features/fast-sha1" ]

#! #### Other
#!
#! The catch-all of feature toggles.

## Data structures implement `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize`.
serde = [   "dep:serde",
    "gix-pack/serde",
    "gix-object/serde",
    "gix-protocol?/serde",
    "gix-transport?/serde",
    "gix-ref/serde",
    "gix-odb/serde",
    "gix-index?/serde",
    "gix-mailmap?/serde",
    "gix-url/serde",
    "gix-attributes?/serde",
    "gix-ignore?/serde",
    "gix-revision/serde",
    "gix-worktree?/serde",
    "gix-commitgraph/serde",
    "gix-credentials?/serde"]

## Re-export the progress tree root which allows to obtain progress from various functions which take `impl gix::Progress`.
## Applications which want to display progress will probably need this implementation.
progress-tree = ["prodash/progress-tree"]

## Print debugging information about usage of object database caches, useful for tuning cache sizes.
cache-efficiency-debug = ["gix-features/cache-efficiency-debug"]
