## 0.30.0 (2023-09-24)

<csr-id-db0c4017142fd25d26d1c6860972b1ac84b24a6e/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-db0c4017142fd25d26d1c6860972b1ac84b24a6e/> add more test cases to pin behaviour around string and path handling.
   This is important to know how to consistently handle empty strings - should they
   not be present? Or should they be flagged as error?
   
   The answer here is that the caller has to deal with it, as we report these values
   if they are present which only requires an equals sign.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-2b8d09f785f471aa12fc6793f0ea40c1f8d9ea4a/> remove `log` dependency in favor of `gix-trace`

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.

## 0.28.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-ef54aab9e5521add4154ee8d902d62612a9d8d4a/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-ef54aab9e5521add4154ee8d902d62612a9d8d4a/> switch `nom` to `winnow` in remaining uses in `gix-object`, `gix-ref`, and `gix-actor` for ~20% more performance.
   It's likely that over time, these parsers will get even faster due to improvements to `winnow`.
   Thanks, Ed Page, for single-handedly performing this transition.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-c51c8daee1ab54130ae3ed83ce67d08f01c4881a/> fix incorrect s/git-config/gix-config/
   3a861c8f049f6502d3bcbdac752659aa1aeda46a just blindly replaced any
   occurence of "git-config" or "git_config" with "gix-config"/"gix_config".
   
   There is no such thing as a gix-config file.
   gix-config is a git-config file parser.
 - <csr-id-66dadf807f41aa9e828639c52a7d220bf4f3df72/> regression that could cause non-linear parsing behaviour.

## 0.21.0 (2023-04-26)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-13edfe96696636c30040ec81ebc4e235ac689429/> use `home` in `env::home_dir()`
 - <csr-id-da9009f807acfe50000724589853a112fc5ab9a4/> Use `gix-path` for obtaining some shared directories as base for path generation.
   This will make system wide configuration available on windows at least when using the migw builds.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

## 0.20.0 (2023-03-26)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-603776ecf487ef087d25774d74e49465177aa370/> binary config output parsing can now deal with quotes on windows.
   Previously we would return paths that contained quotes.
   Note that we don't properly unquote C-style strings
   (which this is: https://github.com/git/git/blob/d9d677b2d8cc5f70499db04e633ba7a400f64cbf/builtin/config.c#L197)
   thinking that the git-binary configuration paths are well-known and don't need the complete decoding.
   If so, this is already implemented in `gix_quote::ansi_c::undo()`.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e55f4ee230ed3164df5145c7a2b212464bb9db99/> allow to ignore IO errors when reading configuration files.
   Sometimes, IO errors can occour consistently when reading from certain
   paths (on Windows, really), and it should be possible to not only see
   which path that is but also to ignore them entirely.
   
   Now IO errors contain the path of the failed configuration file.
   There is also a new option flag to ignore errors (off by default).

## 0.16.2 (2023-02-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4b424ab73d20833deb0c674eeeeaaa8cc2358932/> add `File::write_to_filter()` to have a filter select the section to write.
   This way, one can selectively write sections to a file, based on the section's origin
   or other meta-data.
   
   For convenience sake, most mutating methods on `SectionMut` can now be chained as well.
 - <csr-id-3fa86e1d01a75688cd8948a39ba415bcebfef02d/> add `File::set_meta()` to affect what metadata new sections receive.
   That way it's possible to better control the metadata associated with new sections,
   given that the config file metadata may not truly reflect its identity anymore since it
   can be a combination from many different files with various sources.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-8836f5ada0078febf8aeb0e6b59d0fc4c588bc28/> `File::section(...)` could panic due to invlid expectation.
   This has been fixed to prevent panics.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

### Other (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-69ec5940d3f37eb4dace8f1ed7616b5988984d15/> `File::set_raw_[multi_]value()` to `::set_existing_raw_[multi_]value`.
   This makes clear that the method will fail if the value doesn't yet
   exist.
 - <csr-id-9cd99337333f5ef4b30e0ec9461fc087699576e6/> `File::raw_multi_value()` to `File::raw_values()`
 - <csr-id-0076dcf9b37f1d633bdad5573b40d34a9fbaba90/> `File::raw_multi_value_mut()` to `File::raw_values_mut()`
 - <csr-id-a8604a237782f8d60a185d4730db57bad81424a6/> `File::multi_value()` to `File::values()`.
   The latter is better in line with `string()/strings()`

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0c98ec8fc7d8cc3195472a04fde4a681f620725f/> subsections are identified as `&BStr` in entire API.
   Technically they can be any value (except for newlines and unescaped double quotes),
   and these values might be paths and everything that comes with it, like
   illformed UTF8. In order to be able to represent everything that
   git can represent, we don't enforce UTF8 anymore for subsection names.
   
   Note that section names and key names are required to be valid UTF8
   (and even alphanumeric ascii), which makes illformed UTF8 very unlikely
   there.
 - <csr-id-a93a156655d640ae63ff7c35b0a1f5d67a5ca20f/> Simplify specifying keys when mutating config values.
 - <csr-id-895ce40aabbe6d6af5b681a0d0942303fd6549a2/> `File::rename_section()` with validation of input arguments.
 - <csr-id-4a01d983f54a7713dea523f6032cbf5bb2b9dde8/> improve normalization; assure no extra copies are made on query.
   We now return our own content, rather than the originals with their
   lifetimes, meaning we bind lifetimes of returned values to our own
   `File` instance. This allows them to be referenced more often, and
   smarter normalization assures we don't copy in the simple cases
   either.
   
   More tests were added as well.
   This is breaking as lifetime changes can cause distruptions, and
   `values?_as()` was removed as well as it's somewhat duplicate
   to higher-level APIs and it wasn't tested at all.
 - <csr-id-c9933c0b0f51d21dc8244b2acc33d7dc8a33f6ce/> Remove `git-config` test utilities from `git-path`.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2faad43d11283ff06381c51d2466307cfb8736ff/> transfer knowledge about configuration and its usage into the type system.
   That way it's possible to use configuration overrides, even though ultimately being strings,
   in a type-safe manner and leverage code-completion while at it.
   
   In that process, we also change `Repository::(committer|Author)()` to return
   `Option<Result<...>>` to be able to account for date parse errors.
 - <csr-id-2b36d99eaf3ed24ce4cb736a3dd48440dc0c73b7/> `File::new_section()` and related now returns their `id` as well.
   That way it's possible to more easily interact with it later, for instance
   when one wants to delete it.
 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-b6cd6ace412b0c0df4bacbe7ed7ef6608f27909c/> `file::SectionMut::push()` now supports values without key-value separator.
   These make a difference as those without `=` are considered boolean
   true.
   Currently pushing onto a section is the only way to write them.
 - <csr-id-d003c0f139d61e3bd998a0283a9c7af25a60db02/> Support for `lossy` load mode.
   There is a lot of breaking changes as `file::from_paths::Options` now
   became `file::init::Options`, and the same goes for the error type.
 - <csr-id-1ea26d80f392114349d25ebf88a7b260ee822aa1/> add `_filter()` versions to most access methods.
   That way it's possible to filter values by their origin.
   
   Note that the `remove_section()` methods now return the entire
   removed section, not just the body, which yields more information
   than before including section metadata.
 - <csr-id-cfd974f46d2cbb99e7784a05f5e358fed0d4bcab/> section names are now validated.
 - <csr-id-6ba2f8060768978ad7204e162fb2253ca8843879/> filtering supportort for `parse::Events`.
   That way it's possible to construct Files which are not destined to be
   written back as they only keep events necessary for value access,
   greatly reducing allocations.
 - <csr-id-311d4b447daf8d4364670382a20901468748d34d/> change mostily internal uses of [u8] to BString/BStr
 - <csr-id-edd226719cd04a480274cb7d983b6d5d8bfdbb13/> Path-interpolation makes `home-dir` configurable.
   That way the caller has full control over how the environment is used,
   which also allows more fine-grained control over which config files
   can be included.
 - <csr-id-266d4379e9132fd7dd21e6c8fccb36e125069d6e/> Make `realpath()` easier to use by introducing `realpath_opt()`.
   That way there is consistency about how many symlinks to follow.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-27fb1ce27d2985eb1ee8bee5fffaf759902571fb/> Add `Kind::GitInstallation` for a way to obtain special git-installation configuration paths.
   Note that these are lazily cached as they call the `git` binary.
 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-2b2357e9cc54539e0dbe7c0e22802f2b884160d8/> Add `File::set_raw_value()` to unconditionally set single values, and make the value itself easier to provide.
 - <csr-id-17c83d55f8942788aac5eb1bea22a48daa045bf4/> add `File::resolve_includes()` and move its error type to `file::includes`.
 - <csr-id-5221676e28f2b6cc1a7ef1bdd5654b880965f38c/> add `File::from_bytes_owned()` and remove `File::from_path_with_buf()`
 - <csr-id-98d45c2f59863fdee033b38e757cec09593f6892/> remove `File::from_env_paths()`.
   It's replaced by its more comfortable `new_globals()`.
 - <csr-id-230a523593afcfb8720db965ff56265aaceea772/> untangle `file::init::…` `Option` and `Error` types.
   This moves types to where they belong which is more specific instead
   of having a catch-all `Error` and `Options` type.
 - <csr-id-3f3ff11a6ebe9775ee5ae7fc0ec18a94b5b46d61/> rename `parse::Comment::(comment_tag|comment)` to `::tag|text` and `parse::Section::section_header` to `::header`.
 - <csr-id-6f4eea936d64fb9827277c160f989168e7b1dba2/> Associate `file::Metadata` with each `File`.
   This is the first step towards knowing more about the source of each
   value to filter them based on some properties.
   
   This breaks various methods handling the instantiation of configuration
   files as `file::Metadata` typically has to be provided by the caller
   now or be associated with each path to read configuration from.
 - <csr-id-b672ed7667a334be3d45c59f4727f12797b340da/> rename `file::SectionBody` to `file::section::Body`.
 - <csr-id-3bea26d7d2a9b5751c6c15e1fa9a924b67e0159e/> Remove `File::sections_by_name_with_header()` as `::sections_by_name()` now returns entire sections.
 - <csr-id-41b3e622ee71943c285eadc518150fc7b6c92361/> create `resolve_includes` options to make space for more options when loading paths.
 - <csr-id-cabc8ef0e31c954642525e7693009a7fe4b4c465/> rename `path::Options` into `path::Context`.
   It's not an option if it's required context to perform a certain
   operation.
 - <csr-id-3de0cfd81523e4ba7cc362d8625f85ebf8fd9172/> All accessors in `File` are now using `impl AsRef<str>` where possible for added comfort.
 - <csr-id-3d25fe6c7a52529488fab19c927d64a1bc75838f/> Much more comfortable API `file::*Mut` types thanks to `impl Into/AsRef`.
 - <csr-id-393b392d515661e5c3e60629319fdab771c3d3f0/> Rename `Mutable*` into `$1Mut` for consistency.
 - <csr-id-0a7391a6575f4035c51a46d34fa20c69e9d078e9/> conform APIs of `file::MutableValue` and `file::MutableMultiValue`.
   There are more renames and removals than worth mentioning here given the
   current adoption of the crate.
 - <csr-id-83a0922f06081312b79908835dac2b7f4e849bb3/> rename `file::MutableSection::set_leading_space()` to `set_leading_whitespace()`.
   The corresponding getter was renamed as well to `leading_whitespace()`.
 - <csr-id-219cf7ae0b35b3ac92f97974be52cd022698e01f/> Enforce `parse::section::Header::new()` by making its fields private.
 - <csr-id-4f6cd8cf65c2d8698bffe327a19031c342b229a6/> Add `File::write_to()` and `File::to_bstring()`; remove some `TryFrom` impls.
   Now `File` can be serialized in a streaming fashion and without the
   possibility for UTF8 conversion issues.
   
   Note that `Display` is still imlpemented with the usual caveats.
 - <csr-id-0e392f81e99c8c0ff29f41b9b86afd57cd99c245/> remove `Integer::to_bstring()` as well as some `TryFrom` impls.
   Note that it can still display itself like before via
   `std::fmt::Display`.
 - <csr-id-b22732a2ab17213c4a1020859ec41f25ccabfbfc/> remove `Boolean::to_bstring()` along with a few `From` impls.
   These were superfluous and aren't useful in practice.
   Note that serialization is still implemented via `Display`.
 - <csr-id-65c520c4de8187884f87059adf5cef9cbdcd90a2/> allocation free `File::sections_by_name()` and `File::sections_by_name_with_header()`.
 - <csr-id-ac57c4479e7b6867e8b8e71f7cf76de759dc64a2/> `Path::interpolate()` now takes `path::interpolate::Options` instead of three parameters.
 - <csr-id-0915051798dd782b40617a1aa16abd71f6db1175/> remove `String` type in favor of referring to the `File::string()` method.
   The wrapper had no effect whatsoever except for adding complexity.
 - <csr-id-9cadc6f0cbaad0ac23f5469db2f040aecfbfb82c/> Simplify `Boolean` to be a wrapper around `bool`.
   Previously it tried hard not to degenerate information, making it a
   complicated type.
   
   However, in practice nobody cares about the exact makeup of the boolean,
   and there is no need to serialize a boolean faithfully either.
   
   Instead, those who want to set a value just set any value as a string,
   no need for type safety there, and we take care of escaping values
   properly on write.
 - <csr-id-703922dd4e1e5b27835298217ff4eb8ef1dc57ce/> Use bitflags for `color::Attribute` instead of `Vec` of enums.
   This is less wasteful and sufficient for git, so it should be sufficient
   for us, especially since attributes are indeed a set and declaring
   one twice has no effect.
 - <csr-id-3fc4ac04f46f869c6e3a94ce4bb8a5737aa0c524/> simplify `Color` API.
   For now we only parse and serialize for display, but more uses are
   enabled when needed and trivially.
 - <csr-id-14149eea54e2e8a25ac0ccdb2f6efe624f6eaa22/> remove `parse::Events::from_path` and `File::at`
   The latter has been replaced with `File::from_path_with_buf(…)` and
   is a low-level way to load just a single config file, purposefully
   uncomfortable as it will not resolve includes.
   
   The initialization API will need some time to stabilize.
 - <csr-id-73adceeae12270c0d470d4b7271c1fd6089d5c2d/> Slim down API surface of `parse::Events`.
   It's more of a 'dumb' structure now than before, merely present
   to facilitate typical parsing than something special on its own.
 - <csr-id-2e47167e4a963743494b2df6b0c15800cb876dd0/> remove `File::new()` method in favor of `File::default()`.
 - <csr-id-ea6765093b5475912ba1aa81d4440cbf5dd49fb6/> rename `parse::event::List` to `parse::Events`
 - <csr-id-89f5fca843d999c5bea35fb3fe2a03dc3588f74e/> rename `parse::State` to `parse::event::List`
 - <csr-id-3cdb0890b71e62cfa92b1ed1760c88cb547ec729/> move `value::*` into the crate root, except for `Error` and `normalize_*()`.
 - <csr-id-748d921efd7469d5c19e40ddcb9099e2462e3bbc/> rename `value::parse::Error` to `value::Error`.
 - <csr-id-7e8a22590297f2f4aab76b53be512353637fb651/> rename `value::TrueVariant` to `value::boolean::True`
 - <csr-id-8bcaec0599cf085a73b344f4f53fc023f6e31430/> rename `IntegerSuffix` to `integer::Suffix`
 - <csr-id-d085037ad9c067af7ce3ba3ab6e5d5ddb45b4057/> rename `value::Color(Attribute|Value)` to `value::color::Attribute` and `value::color::Name`.
 - <csr-id-a0f6252343a62b0b55eef02888ac00c09100687a/> Turn `parse::ParseOrIoError` into `parse::state::from_path::Error`
 - <csr-id-b6b31e9c8dd8b3dc4860431069bb1cf5eacd1702/> rename `parse::ParsedComment` into `parse::Comment`
 - <csr-id-239cbfb450a8cddfc5bec1de21f3dc54fab914ce/> rename `parse::Section*` related types.
   These are now located in `section::*`.
 - <csr-id-60af4c9ecb1b99f21df0e8facc33e5f6fc70c424/> rename `parse::Parser` to `parse::State`.
   Furthermore, make `State` the entry point for all parsing, removing
   all free-standing functions that returned a `State`.
 - <csr-id-3724850e0411f1f76e52c6c767fd8cebe8aea0f6/> rename `parser` module to `parse`
 - <csr-id-58b22152a0295998935abb43563e9096589ef53e/> rename `normalize_cow()` to `normalize()` and move all `normalize*` functions from `values` to the `value` module
 - <csr-id-767bedccdae1f3e6faf853d59ecf884a06cc3827/> move `Path` from `values` to `value` module
 - <csr-id-6033f3f93d2356399a661567353a83a044662699/> Move `Boolean` and `String` from `values` into `value` module
 - <csr-id-d4444e18042891b0fe5b9c6e6813fed26df6c560/> move `values::Integer` into `value` module
 - <csr-id-38f31174e8c117af675cdfbc21926133b821ec38/> move `Color` to own `value` module
 - <csr-id-aa630ad6ec2c6306d3307d5c77e272cb24b00ddd/> remove `values::Bytes` - use `values::String` instead.
   Note that these values are always normalized and it's only possible
   to get a raw values using the `raw_value()` API.
 - <csr-id-553f87225363903e6acdb3e7eaa8cc66a91110f1/> `File::len()` -> `File::num_values()`
   The same is true for `Section::len()` which now is
   `Section::num_values()`.
 - <csr-id-c7fcb5e1db225aefc3eeab4f29f3fb85c670894a/> `GitConfig::from_paths(…, <option>)` is now owned.
   The type is `Copy`, so no need to pass it by reference.
 - <csr-id-38dfdcf80f9b7368ccaa10f4b78b2129849848d0/> remove `values::*Error` in favor of `value::parse::Error`.
   This makes it easier to work with errors in practice, we are either
   interested in the value that failed to parse to try something else
   or want a nice user message.
   
   Having one decode error type facilitates that.
 - <csr-id-a98a7a7af69482e9ef63f106184049049939459d/> switch from quickerror to thiserror.
   This allows for generic types for sources of errors and allows to
   workaround a limitation with associated type constraints in the MSRV
   of 1.54.
   
   Using thiserror makes this work and brings the crate more closely
   to the rest of the gitoxide crates (which now prefer thiserror over
   quickerror).
 - <csr-id-a86b2541561674df5dbef4120d3e03483cb80117/> remove all `get_` prefixes from methods
   That way the API is more idiomatic and fits better into the
   existing `gitoxide` crates.
 - <csr-id-f9aaac11f0734afbd791132369eb5601bfc7efe9/> use `lookup::Error` and `lookup::existing::Error`
   Use the newly introduced structured error to replace the 'catch-all'
   `GitConfigError` while getting closer to naming conventions in other
   `gitoxide` crates.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-55c00d880535a1f8c37cb7d4405d39ff5a7654a0/> remove `git_config::values::Value`; use `Bytes` in its place.

### Other

 - <csr-id-32d5b3c695d868ba93755123a25b276bfbe55e0a/> :Events::from_bytes()` with `filter` support.
 - <csr-id-949622e461eb2116393ec6f4633ec0cb2e1695b5/> Include benches in crate to allow publishing to work
 - <csr-id-bcacfc9bcf19a0339541b24e84de68d95291c62b/> remove clippy-cargo lint until there are no warnings
   Please feel free to re-add once all other git-* crates have been
   adjusted. It's interesting to see how a crate lint spills into the
   workspace.
   
   Personally I am surprised that the keywords value is supposed
   to repeat the crate name as it seems redundant.
 - <csr-id-41f118d2aa560188fd3399d2390aa43794b0af75/> remove redundant lines from git-ignore file

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8836f5ada0078febf8aeb0e6b59d0fc4c588bc28/> `File::section(...)` could panic due to invlid expectation.
   This has been fixed to prevent panics.
 - <csr-id-839f776454d7a8522c0f2887c90fc41b20576bd9/> `File::boolean()` now correctly handles implicit bools across sections.
   This means it will return the last implicit value as true, instead of
   ignoring it to fall back onto an explicit boolean value that might be
   false.
 - <csr-id-7d92c61abc2c54f4a64c35b37bcd1843a8d1da9c/> `file::SectionMut::push()` now properly creates empty values.
   Previously, when calling `.push("key", None)`, the resulting internal
   state would be slighly wrong causing certain invariants and expectations
   to be unfulfilled even though it might have looked OK to most users.
   
   Now it will uphold the invariant for empty values, those without an
   `=` character.
 - <csr-id-9c1e639979a9615fd8334ce0e3a809df137776f6/> greatly improve whitespace handling when removing values.
   Previously, newlines would remain past a value, and whitespace could
   remain before one.
   
   Now both are removed to simulate removing an actual line.
 - <csr-id-e533993e8f861ba7a6600aab114ddfecc8a85ee2/> `File::remove_section()` was fixed to allow re-adding a similarly named section.
   We also add `File::remove_section_by_id()` to make it possible to remove
   specific sections.
 - <csr-id-08c50a47fa901457194539c7db74ad47ab2f8b60/> Properly handle boolean values such that `a` is true but `a=` is false.
   This is even consistent when no booleans are used, such that `a` has no
   value as if it is not present, it's only available for booleans which
   must be specified.
 - <csr-id-7c585162454c476fe93f032c8a2329cffd7c054f/> Keep track of a severe limitation and prepare tests for fixing it.
   This also changes behaviour, but merely removes a hack in `Boolean`
   which considered empty strings true, even though they are supposed to be
   false.
 - <csr-id-6c1588fd1a2fa80fd866787cbf4bcc6e5b51abe6/> maintain insertion order of includes on per-section basis at least.
   Note that git inserts values right after the include directive,
   'splitting' the section, but we don't do that and insert new values
   after the section. Probably no issue in practice while keeping
   our implementation simple.
 - <csr-id-f7bd2caceb87a179288030e0771da2e4ed6bd1e4/> maintain newline format depending on what's present or use platform default.
   Previously implicit newlines when adding new sections or keys to
   sections was always `\n` which isn't correct on windows.
   
   Now the newline style is detected and used according to what's present,
   or in the lack of content, defaults to what's correct for the platform.
 - <csr-id-0d07ef1aa4a9e238c20249d4ae2ed19e6740308a/> validate incoming conifguration keys when interpreting envirnoment variables.
 - <csr-id-6b901843cb18b3d31f8b0b84bb9ebbae279aff19/> `Boolean` can use numbers to indicate true or false, drops support for `one` and `zero`.
 - <csr-id-94dde44e8dd1a0b8d4e11f2627a3f6b345a15989/> `file::MutableSection::remove()` now actually removes keys _and_ values.
 - <csr-id-048b92531eb877a5a128e702504891bf1e31becf/> `file::MutableMultiValue` escapes input values and maintains key separator specific whitespace.
 - <csr-id-f911707b455ba6f3800b85f667f91e4d56027b91/> value normalization (via `value::normalize()` handles escape sequences.
   The latter ones are `\n`, `\t` and `\b` which are the only supported
   ones in values of git-config files.
 - <csr-id-44dfec07480cc2ac6fd01674b748cc03af51fed1/> stable sort order for `File::sections_by_name_with_header()`
 - <csr-id-1ea919d5ff81ab7b01b8201386ef63c7e081b537/> count newlines (for error display) in multi-line values as well
 - <csr-id-1e71e71c984289f0d7e0a39379ee6728918b7dc5/> auto-normalize string values to support quote removal in case of strings.
   Related to https://github.com/starship/starship/pull/3883 .
 - <csr-id-36e2fc0aff4e6aaa35335da90108918882d4cd16/> Use `std::env::var_os()` to avoid potential decode errors

### New Features

<csr-id-61af06b905926849abce19677ff4b9ac05d625a3/>

 - <csr-id-4b424ab73d20833deb0c674eeeeaaa8cc2358932/> add `File::write_to_filter()` to have a filter select the section to write.
   This way, one can selectively write sections to a file, based on the section's origin
   or other meta-data.
   
   For convenience sake, most mutating methods on `SectionMut` can now be chained as well.
 - <csr-id-3fa86e1d01a75688cd8948a39ba415bcebfef02d/> add `File::set_meta()` to affect what metadata new sections receive.
   That way it's possible to better control the metadata associated with new sections,
   given that the config file metadata may not truly reflect its identity anymore since it
   can be a combination from many different files with various sources.
 - <csr-id-5b9bffe8a5eec738e892224a7e18f98c8430d8a4/> `SectionMut::push_with_comment(key, comment)` to add a new variable with a comment.
   This is useful for providing more information about a value at hand, especially if it was
   added programmatically and then shows up in the configuration.
 - <csr-id-e4bf8f0072e60a7a2df94690c8d0b13b1f3038bb/> Add the `Source::EnvOverride` to have a place for 'terminal' overrides.
   That way environment variables represented via git-configuration
   can be integrated into git configuration, making clearer what's
   going to happen even when looking at the configuration via
   `gix config`.
   
   The implementation has to be careful though about assureing there
   is no more specific configuration key, like `http.<URL>.proxy` that
   would override the one from the environment, which always has
   the final word.
 - <csr-id-5fa95460db843f7dcfe68002b303b8b7649846dd/> comfort API like `string_by_key(key)` takes a key like `"remote.origin.url"`, add `section_by_key("remote.origin")` as well.
   That way it's the most comfortable way to query values and very
   similar to how git does it, too.
   
   Additionally, sections can be obtained by section key, both mutably and immutably for completeness.
 - <csr-id-7d7bd02d4e0678565f58c5da83fd1ad88c60e911/> read worktree specific configuration of main worktrees.
   Supporting this is useful when interacting with worktrees that have been
   created with sparse worktree support, which moves some configuration
   values into those for the worktree at hand.
   
   Note that linked worktrees are not supported - for that use
   `git-repository` instead.
 - <csr-id-aa5d66f60bd6c9ef404ebc120b613e0cf055b2c9/> add `parse::section::header::is_valid_subsection()` function.
   It can be useful to validate subsection names without having to
   construct an entire `Header` (which also includes a name).
 - <csr-id-5df2a2a5a9addbda7dcc68b2f8f7f4a48d9720c6/> Add various methods to iterate sections along with their id, and mutate them.
   As section names are not unique, it was previously not possible to
   iterate sections and then mutate them as one wouldn't be able to refer
   to the exact section that was just traversed, after all, there can be
   many sections named `remote "origin"`.
   
   With the new methods it's possible to uniquely refer to each section
   for mutation and removal.

 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-1bc96bf378d198b012efce9ec9e5b244a91f62bc/> following includes is now non-fatal by default
   Otherwise it would be relatively easy to fail gitoxide startup,
   and we want to be closer to the behaviour in git which ignores
   most of the errors.
 - <csr-id-f9ce1b5411f1ac788f71060ecf785dda9dfd87bf/> `File::from_git_dir()` as comfortable way to instantiate most complete git configuration.
 - <csr-id-14a68a6a78a09f8ae56e30e3b7501de66ef31fdc/> `File` now compares actual content, ignoring whitespace and comments.

 - <csr-id-09966a8ea4eaa3e0805e04188de86dd1bac9f388/> `File::append()` can append one file to another rather losslessly.
   The loss happens as we, maybe for the wrong reasons, automatically
   insert newlines where needed which can only be done while we still know
   the file boundaries.
 - <csr-id-56ae5744e8957e617f3a0ebc4d725846b18d93f8/> `file::Section::meta()` to access a section's metadata.

 - <csr-id-9f59356b4f6a1f5f7f35a62c9fbe4859bf8e8e5f/> whitespace in newly pushed keys is derived from first section value.
   That way, newly added key-value pairs look like they should assuming
   all keys have the same indentation as the first key in the section.
   
   If there is no key, then the default whitespace will be double-tabs
   like what's commmon in git.
 - <csr-id-db1f34dfb855058ac08e97d4715876b5db712f61/> `File::from_str()` implementation, to support `let config: File = "[core]".parse()?`
 - <csr-id-9157717c2fb143b5decbdf60d18cc2bd99dde775/> whitespace in mutable sections can be finely controlled, and is derived from existing sections
 - <csr-id-ae3895c7882e0a543a44693faee5f760b49b54d7/> `parse::Header::new(…)` with sub-section name validation
 - <csr-id-d087f12eec73626eb327eaacef8ebb3836b02381/> Add `parse::(Event|section::Header|Comment)::write_to(…)`.

   interpreted and checked for overflow.
 - <csr-id-ae22a4de486676f11469cec84be403903758b48b/> add `GitConfig::integer()`
   A way to quickly obtain a valid integer with suffixes resolved
   and overflow checked.
 - <csr-id-bfc263797226d027e04daaf6426e57183773d7c3/> `GitConfig::strings()` for multi-value strings.
 - <csr-id-7c75eac149c6ecb99c3dd7355d76d8d3e8b59cd0/> `GitConfig::path()` for direct access to paths.
   Very similar to `string()`, but as path, whose query can never fail.
 - <csr-id-dc3dc3b41b5de3ec17429769747bf99bb2bdd03d/> support for `try_value()`, `boolean()` and `string()` access`.
   Support for a convenient way of knowing if a value does or doesn't exist
   via `try_value()`, which can only fail if the conversion fails.
   
   Lastly, `string()` is a special case which doesn't fail as there is
   no conversion, and `boolean()` allows to obtain a plain boolean value
   if it was a valid boolean representation.
 - <csr-id-13554f8d21beb241e0fbdeb56b8414957cbee28a/> new hierarchical errors for value lookup
 - <csr-id-031bd2f401199a05d6465c0260ceed3cc849c7ac/> add suppport for android
   Do not interpolate `~user/` on Android (Termux).
   There is no meaning of it. It is single user system.

   can be interpolated according to gits own path interpolation
   rules.
 - <csr-id-e822f566dcff3f6c784c206dff2fbc5f82d543be/> implement a draft for subsection fetching

## 0.16.0 (2023-02-09)

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2faad43d11283ff06381c51d2466307cfb8736ff/> transfer knowledge about configuration and its usage into the type system.
   That way it's possible to use configuration overrides, even though ultimately being strings,
   in a type-safe manner and leverage code-completion while at it.
   
   In that process, we also change `Repository::(committer|Author)()` to return
   `Option<Result<...>>` to be able to account for date parse errors.

## 0.15.1 (2023-01-10)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.15.0 (2023-01-09)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.14.0 (2022-12-30)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.13.0 (2022-12-19)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-5b9bffe8a5eec738e892224a7e18f98c8430d8a4/> `SectionMut::push_with_comment(key, comment)` to add a new variable with a comment.
   This is useful for providing more information about a value at hand, especially if it was
   added programmatically and then shows up in the configuration.
 - <csr-id-e4bf8f0072e60a7a2df94690c8d0b13b1f3038bb/> Add the `Source::EnvOverride` to have a place for 'terminal' overrides.
   That way environment variables represented via git-configuration
   can be integrated into git configuration, making clearer what's
   going to happen even when looking at the configuration via
   `gix config`.
   
   The implementation has to be careful though about assuring there
   is no more specific configuration key, like `http.<URL>.proxy` that
   would override the one from the environment, which always has
   the final word.
 - <csr-id-5fa95460db843f7dcfe68002b303b8b7649846dd/> comfort API like `string_by_key(key)` takes a key like `"remote.origin.url"`, add `section_by_key("remote.origin")` as well.
   That way it's the most comfortable way to query values and very
   similar to how git does it, too.
   
   Additionally, sections can be obtained by section key, both mutably and immutably for completeness.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2b36d99eaf3ed24ce4cb736a3dd48440dc0c73b7/> `File::new_section()` and related now returns their `id` as well.
   That way it's possible to more easily interact with it later, for instance
   when one wants to delete it.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0c98ec8fc7d8cc3195472a04fde4a681f620725f/> subsections are identified as `&BStr` in entire API.
   Technically they can be any value (except for newlines and unescaped double quotes),
   and these values might be paths and everything that comes with it, like
   illformed UTF8. In order to be able to represent everything that
   git can represent, we don't enforce UTF8 anymore for subsection names.
   
   Note that section names and key names are required to be valid UTF8
   (and even alphanumeric ascii), which makes illformed UTF8 very unlikely
   there.

## 0.12.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7d7bd02d4e0678565f58c5da83fd1ad88c60e911/> read worktree specific configuration of main worktrees.
   Supporting this is useful when interacting with worktrees that have been
   created with sparse worktree support, which moves some configuration
   values into those for the worktree at hand.
   
   Note that linked worktrees are not supported - for that use
   `gix` instead.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.11.0 (2022-11-17)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.10.0 (2022-11-06)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-839f776454d7a8522c0f2887c90fc41b20576bd9/> `File::boolean()` now correctly handles implicit bools across sections.
   This means it will return the last implicit value as true, instead of
   ignoring it to fall back onto an explicit boolean value that might be
   false.
 - <csr-id-7d92c61abc2c54f4a64c35b37bcd1843a8d1da9c/> `file::SectionMut::push()` now properly creates empty values.
   Previously, when calling `.push("key", None)`, the resulting internal
   state would be slightly wrong causing certain invariants and expectations
   to be unfulfilled even though it might have looked OK to most users.
   
   Now it will uphold the invariant for empty values, those without an
   `=` character.

## 0.9.0 (2022-10-10)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-aa5d66f60bd6c9ef404ebc120b613e0cf055b2c9/> add `parse::section::header::is_valid_subsection()` function.
   It can be useful to validate subsection names without having to
   construct an entire `Header` (which also includes a name).
 - <csr-id-5df2a2a5a9addbda7dcc68b2f8f7f4a48d9720c6/> Add various methods to iterate sections along with their id, and mutate them.
   As section names are not unique, it was previously not possible to
   iterate sections and then mutate them as one wouldn't be able to refer
   to the exact section that was just traversed, after all, there can be
   many sections named `remote "origin"`.
   
   With the new methods it's possible to uniquely refer to each section
   for mutation and removal.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9c1e639979a9615fd8334ce0e3a809df137776f6/> greatly improve whitespace handling when removing values.
   Previously, newlines would remain past a value, and whitespace could
   remain before one.
   
   Now both are removed to simulate removing an actual line.
 - <csr-id-e533993e8f861ba7a6600aab114ddfecc8a85ee2/> `File::remove_section()` was fixed to allow re-adding a similarly named section.
   We also add `File::remove_section_by_id()` to make it possible to remove
   specific sections.

## 0.8.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed

 - <csr-id-5ad296577d837b0699b4718fa2be3d0978c4e342/> `gix-config` now uses `gix-config-value`.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-27fb1ce27d2985eb1ee8bee5fffaf759902571fb/> Add `Kind::GitInstallation` for a way to obtain special git-installation configuration paths.
   Note that these are lazily cached as they call the `git` binary.
 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`

## 0.7.1 (2022-08-28)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.7.0 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-69ec5940d3f37eb4dace8f1ed7616b5988984d15/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### New Features

 - <csr-id-9937d0e00df3a523484c7ae2850be2712a1a4c9a/> `File::set_raw_value_filter()` to set values only in sections passing a filter.
 - <csr-id-17455c9d93ad38bfee2560f5a4e60324dee3b4e5/> `File::section_mut_or_create_new_filter()` to allow choosing which sections to add values to.
 - <csr-id-5902f54b93101a6290fcf89f9f13fdbea3678e00/> `File::section_mut_or_create_new(…)` to obtain an existing or new section for mutation.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-08c50a47fa901457194539c7db74ad47ab2f8b60/> Properly handle boolean values such that `a` is true but `a=` is false.
   This is even consistent when no booleans are used, such that `a` has no
   value as if it is not present, it's only available for booleans which
   must be specified.
 - <csr-id-7c585162454c476fe93f032c8a2329cffd7c054f/> Keep track of a severe limitation and prepare tests for fixing it.
   This also changes behaviour, but merely removes a hack in `Boolean`
   which considered empty strings true, even though they are supposed to be
   false.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2b2357e9cc54539e0dbe7c0e22802f2b884160d8/> Add `File::set_raw_value()` to unconditionally set single values, and make the value itself easier to provide.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b6cd6ace412b0c0df4bacbe7ed7ef6608f27909c/> `file::SectionMut::push()` now supports values without key-value separator.
   These make a difference as those without `=` are considered boolean
   true.
   Currently pushing onto a section is the only way to write them.

### Other (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-69ec5940d3f37eb4dace8f1ed7616b5988984d15/> `File::set_raw_[multi_]value()` to `::set_existing_raw_[multi_]value`.
   This makes clear that the method will fail if the value doesn't yet
   exist.

## 0.6.1 (2022-08-17)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

## 0.6.0 (2022-07-22)

<csr-id-a8604a237782f8d60a185d4730db57bad81424a6/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-1bc96bf378d198b012efce9ec9e5b244a91f62bc/> following includes is now non-fatal by default
   Otherwise it would be relatively easy to fail gitoxide startup,
   and we want to be closer to the behaviour in git which ignores
   most of the errors.
 - <csr-id-f9ce1b5411f1ac788f71060ecf785dda9dfd87bf/> `File::from_git_dir()` as comfortable way to instantiate most complete git configuration.
 - <csr-id-14a68a6a78a09f8ae56e30e3b7501de66ef31fdc/> `File` now compares actual content, ignoring whitespace and comments.
 - <csr-id-7dadfd82494d47e36d3f570988eaf3c6b628977f/> `File::new_environment_overrides()` to easily instantiate overrides from the environment.
 - <csr-id-146eeb064822839bc46fd37a247a1b9a84f64e40/> `File::new_globals()` can instantiate non-local configuration with zero-configuration.
 - <csr-id-e701e053fd05850973930be0cefe73e8f3604d40/> `Source::storage_location()` to know where files should be located.
 - <csr-id-fff088485dd5067976cc93d525903b39aafea76a/> `file::ValueMut::(section|into_section_mut)()` to go from value to the owning section.
   This can be useful if the value was obtained using `raw_value_mut()`.
 - <csr-id-f5f2d9b3fef98d9100d713f9291510fa4aa27867/> `Source::is_in_repository()` to find out if a source is in the repository.
 - <csr-id-91e718f0e116052b64ca436d7c74cea79529e696/> `parse::key` to parse a `remote.origin.url`-like key to identify a value
 - <csr-id-26147a7a61a695eda680808ee4aab44a890b2964/> Add `File::detect_newline_style()`, which does at it says.
 - <csr-id-0ad1c9a5280cc172432b5258e0f79898721bac68/> `File::frontmatter()` and `File::sections_and_postmatter()`.
 - <csr-id-fc7e311b423c5fffb8240d9d0f917ae7139a6133/> `parse::Event::to_bstr_lossy()` to get a glimpse at event content.
 - <csr-id-09966a8ea4eaa3e0805e04188de86dd1bac9f388/> `File::append()` can append one file to another rather losslessly.
   The loss happens as we, maybe for the wrong reasons, automatically
   insert newlines where needed which can only be done while we still know
   the file boundaries.
 - <csr-id-56ae5744e8957e617f3a0ebc4d725846b18d93f8/> `file::Section::meta()` to access a section's metadata.
 - <csr-id-6f97bf0c3e7164855cf5aa53462dbc39c430e03f/> `File::sections()` to obtain an iterator over all sections, in order.
 - <csr-id-5418bc70e67476f8778656f2d577f1f9aa65ffbe/> place spaces around `key = value` pairs, or whatever is used in the source configuration.
 - <csr-id-8118644625dc25b616e5f33c85f5100d600766e4/> proper escaping of value bytes to allow round-tripping after mutation
 - <csr-id-9f59356b4f6a1f5f7f35a62c9fbe4859bf8e8e5f/> whitespace in newly pushed keys is derived from first section value.
   That way, newly added key-value pairs look like they should assuming
   all keys have the same indentation as the first key in the section.
   
   If there is no key, then the default whitespace will be double-tabs
   like what's common in git.
 - <csr-id-db1f34dfb855058ac08e97d4715876b5db712f61/> `File::from_str()` implementation, to support `let config: File = "[core]".parse()?`
 - <csr-id-9157717c2fb143b5decbdf60d18cc2bd99dde775/> whitespace in mutable sections can be finely controlled, and is derived from existing sections
 - <csr-id-ae3895c7882e0a543a44693faee5f760b49b54d7/> `parse::Header::new(…)` with sub-section name validation
 - <csr-id-d087f12eec73626eb327eaacef8ebb3836b02381/> Add `parse::(Event|section::Header|Comment)::write_to(…)`.
   Now it's possible to serialize these types in a streaming fashion and
   without arbitrarily enforcing UTF-8 on it
 - <csr-id-5a8f242ee98793e2467e7bc9806f8780b9d320ce/> `serde1` feature to add limited serde support

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-6c1588fd1a2fa80fd866787cbf4bcc6e5b51abe6/> maintain insertion order of includes on per-section basis at least.
   Note that git inserts values right after the include directive,
   'splitting' the section, but we don't do that and insert new values
   after the section. Probably no issue in practice while keeping
   our implementation simple.
 - <csr-id-f7bd2caceb87a179288030e0771da2e4ed6bd1e4/> maintain newline format depending on what's present or use platform default.
   Previously implicit newlines when adding new sections or keys to
   sections was always `\n` which isn't correct on windows.
   
   Now the newline style is detected and used according to what's present,
   or in the lack of content, defaults to what's correct for the platform.
 - <csr-id-0d07ef1aa4a9e238c20249d4ae2ed19e6740308a/> validate incoming configuration keys when interpreting environment variables.

   The latter ones are `\n`, `\t` and `\b` which are the only supported
   ones in values of gix-config files.
 - <csr-id-44dfec07480cc2ac6fd01674b748cc03af51fed1/> stable sort order for `File::sections_by_name_with_header()`

### Other

 - <csr-id-32d5b3c695d868ba93755123a25b276bfbe55e0a/> :Events::from_bytes()` with `filter` support.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-17c83d55f8942788aac5eb1bea22a48daa045bf4/> add `File::resolve_includes()` and move its error type to `file::includes`.
 - <csr-id-5221676e28f2b6cc1a7ef1bdd5654b880965f38c/> add `File::from_bytes_owned()` and remove `File::from_path_with_buf()`
 - <csr-id-98d45c2f59863fdee033b38e757cec09593f6892/> remove `File::from_env_paths()`.
   It's replaced by its more comfortable `new_globals()`.
 - <csr-id-230a523593afcfb8720db965ff56265aaceea772/> untangle `file::init::…` `Option` and `Error` types.
   This moves types to where they belong which is more specific instead
   of having a catch-all `Error` and `Options` type.
 - <csr-id-3f3ff11a6ebe9775ee5ae7fc0ec18a94b5b46d61/> rename `parse::Comment::(comment_tag|comment)` to `::tag|text` and `parse::Section::section_header` to `::header`.
 - <csr-id-6f4eea936d64fb9827277c160f989168e7b1dba2/> Associate `file::Metadata` with each `File`.
   This is the first step towards knowing more about the source of each
   value to filter them based on some properties.
   
   This breaks various methods handling the instantiation of configuration
   files as `file::Metadata` typically has to be provided by the caller
   now or be associated with each path to read configuration from.
 - <csr-id-b672ed7667a334be3d45c59f4727f12797b340da/> rename `file::SectionBody` to `file::section::Body`.
 - <csr-id-3bea26d7d2a9b5751c6c15e1fa9a924b67e0159e/> Remove `File::sections_by_name_with_header()` as `::sections_by_name()` now returns entire sections.
 - <csr-id-41b3e622ee71943c285eadc518150fc7b6c92361/> create `resolve_includes` options to make space for more options when loading paths.
 - <csr-id-cabc8ef0e31c954642525e7693009a7fe4b4c465/> rename `path::Options` into `path::Context`.
   It's not an option if it's required context to perform a certain
   operation.
 - <csr-id-3de0cfd81523e4ba7cc362d8625f85ebf8fd9172/> All accessors in `File` are now using `impl AsRef<str>` where possible for added comfort.
 - <csr-id-3d25fe6c7a52529488fab19c927d64a1bc75838f/> Much more comfortable API `file::*Mut` types thanks to `impl Into/AsRef`.
 - <csr-id-393b392d515661e5c3e60629319fdab771c3d3f0/> Rename `Mutable*` into `$1Mut` for consistency.
 - <csr-id-0a7391a6575f4035c51a46d34fa20c69e9d078e9/> conform APIs of `file::MutableValue` and `file::MutableMultiValue`.
   There are more renames and removals than worth mentioning here given the
   current adoption of the crate.
 - <csr-id-83a0922f06081312b79908835dac2b7f4e849bb3/> rename `file::MutableSection::set_leading_space()` to `set_leading_whitespace()`.
   The corresponding getter was renamed as well to `leading_whitespace()`.
 - <csr-id-219cf7ae0b35b3ac92f97974be52cd022698e01f/> Enforce `parse::section::Header::new()` by making its fields private.
 - <csr-id-4f6cd8cf65c2d8698bffe327a19031c342b229a6/> Add `File::write_to()` and `File::to_bstring()`; remove some `TryFrom` impls.
   Now `File` can be serialized in a streaming fashion and without the
   possibility for UTF8 conversion issues.
   
   Note that `Display` is still implemented with the usual caveats.
 - <csr-id-0e392f81e99c8c0ff29f41b9b86afd57cd99c245/> remove `Integer::to_bstring()` as well as some `TryFrom` impls.
   Note that it can still display itself like before via
   `std::fmt::Display`.
 - <csr-id-b22732a2ab17213c4a1020859ec41f25ccabfbfc/> remove `Boolean::to_bstring()` along with a few `From` impls.
   These were superfluous and aren't useful in practice.
   Note that serialization is still implemented via `Display`.
 - <csr-id-65c520c4de8187884f87059adf5cef9cbdcd90a2/> allocation free `File::sections_by_name()` and `File::sections_by_name_with_header()`.
 - <csr-id-ac57c4479e7b6867e8b8e71f7cf76de759dc64a2/> `Path::interpolate()` now takes `path::interpolate::Options` instead of three parameters.
 - <csr-id-0915051798dd782b40617a1aa16abd71f6db1175/> remove `String` type in favor of referring to the `File::string()` method.
   The wrapper had no effect whatsoever except for adding complexity.
 - <csr-id-9cadc6f0cbaad0ac23f5469db2f040aecfbfb82c/> Simplify `Boolean` to be a wrapper around `bool`.
   Previously it tried hard not to degenerate information, making it a
   complicated type.
   
   However, in practice nobody cares about the exact makeup of the boolean,
   and there is no need to serialize a boolean faithfully either.
   
   Instead, those who want to set a value just set any value as a string,
   no need for type safety there, and we take care of escaping values
   properly on write.
 - <csr-id-703922dd4e1e5b27835298217ff4eb8ef1dc57ce/> Use bitflags for `color::Attribute` instead of `Vec` of enums.
   This is less wasteful and sufficient for git, so it should be sufficient
   for us, especially since attributes are indeed a set and declaring
   one twice has no effect.
 - <csr-id-3fc4ac04f46f869c6e3a94ce4bb8a5737aa0c524/> simplify `Color` API.
   For now we only parse and serialize for display, but more uses are
   enabled when needed and trivially.
 - <csr-id-14149eea54e2e8a25ac0ccdb2f6efe624f6eaa22/> remove `parse::Events::from_path` and `File::at`
   The latter has been replaced with `File::from_path_with_buf(…)` and
   is a low-level way to load just a single config file, purposefully
   uncomfortable as it will not resolve includes.
   
   The initialization API will need some time to stabilize.
 - <csr-id-73adceeae12270c0d470d4b7271c1fd6089d5c2d/> Slim down API surface of `parse::Events`.
   It's more of a 'dumb' structure now than before, merely present
   to facilitate typical parsing than something special on its own.
 - <csr-id-2e47167e4a963743494b2df6b0c15800cb876dd0/> remove `File::new()` method in favor of `File::default()`.
 - <csr-id-ea6765093b5475912ba1aa81d4440cbf5dd49fb6/> rename `parse::event::List` to `parse::Events`
 - <csr-id-89f5fca843d999c5bea35fb3fe2a03dc3588f74e/> rename `parse::State` to `parse::event::List`
 - <csr-id-3cdb0890b71e62cfa92b1ed1760c88cb547ec729/> move `value::*` into the crate root, except for `Error` and `normalize_*()`.
 - <csr-id-748d921efd7469d5c19e40ddcb9099e2462e3bbc/> rename `value::parse::Error` to `value::Error`.
 - <csr-id-7e8a22590297f2f4aab76b53be512353637fb651/> rename `value::TrueVariant` to `value::boolean::True`
 - <csr-id-8bcaec0599cf085a73b344f4f53fc023f6e31430/> rename `IntegerSuffix` to `integer::Suffix`
 - <csr-id-d085037ad9c067af7ce3ba3ab6e5d5ddb45b4057/> rename `value::Color(Attribute|Value)` to `value::color::Attribute` and `value::color::Name`.
 - <csr-id-a0f6252343a62b0b55eef02888ac00c09100687a/> Turn `parse::ParseOrIoError` into `parse::state::from_path::Error`
 - <csr-id-b6b31e9c8dd8b3dc4860431069bb1cf5eacd1702/> rename `parse::ParsedComment` into `parse::Comment`
 - <csr-id-239cbfb450a8cddfc5bec1de21f3dc54fab914ce/> rename `parse::Section*` related types.
   These are now located in `section::*`.
 - <csr-id-60af4c9ecb1b99f21df0e8facc33e5f6fc70c424/> rename `parse::Parser` to `parse::State`.
   Furthermore, make `State` the entry point for all parsing, removing
   all free-standing functions that returned a `State`.
 - <csr-id-3724850e0411f1f76e52c6c767fd8cebe8aea0f6/> rename `parser` module to `parse`
 - <csr-id-58b22152a0295998935abb43563e9096589ef53e/> rename `normalize_cow()` to `normalize()` and move all `normalize*` functions from `values` to the `value` module
 - <csr-id-767bedccdae1f3e6faf853d59ecf884a06cc3827/> move `Path` from `values` to `value` module
 - <csr-id-6033f3f93d2356399a661567353a83a044662699/> Move `Boolean` and `String` from `values` into `value` module
 - <csr-id-d4444e18042891b0fe5b9c6e6813fed26df6c560/> move `values::Integer` into `value` module
 - <csr-id-38f31174e8c117af675cdfbc21926133b821ec38/> move `Color` to own `value` module
 - <csr-id-aa630ad6ec2c6306d3307d5c77e272cb24b00ddd/> remove `values::Bytes` - use `values::String` instead.
   Note that these values are always normalized and it's only possible
   to get a raw values using the `raw_value()` API.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d003c0f139d61e3bd998a0283a9c7af25a60db02/> Support for `lossy` load mode.
   There is a lot of breaking changes as `file::from_paths::Options` now
   became `file::init::Options`, and the same goes for the error type.
 - <csr-id-1ea26d80f392114349d25ebf88a7b260ee822aa1/> add `_filter()` versions to most access methods.
   That way it's possible to filter values by their origin.
   
   Note that the `remove_section()` methods now return the entire
   removed section, not just the body, which yields more information
   than before including section metadata.
 - <csr-id-cfd974f46d2cbb99e7784a05f5e358fed0d4bcab/> section names are now validated.
 - <csr-id-6ba2f8060768978ad7204e162fb2253ca8843879/> filtering support for `parse::Events`.
   That way it's possible to construct Files which are not destined to be
   written back as they only keep events necessary for value access,
   greatly reducing allocations.
 - <csr-id-311d4b447daf8d4364670382a20901468748d34d/> change mostly internal uses of [u8] to BString/BStr
 - <csr-id-edd226719cd04a480274cb7d983b6d5d8bfdbb13/> Path-interpolation makes `home-dir` configurable.
   That way the caller has full control over how the environment is used,
   which also allows more fine-grained control over which config files
   can be included.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-a93a156655d640ae63ff7c35b0a1f5d67a5ca20f/> Simplify specifying keys when mutating config values.
 - <csr-id-895ce40aabbe6d6af5b681a0d0942303fd6549a2/> `File::rename_section()` with validation of input arguments.
 - <csr-id-4a01d983f54a7713dea523f6032cbf5bb2b9dde8/> improve normalization; assure no extra copies are made on query.
   We now return our own content, rather than the originals with their
   lifetimes, meaning we bind lifetimes of returned values to our own
   `File` instance. This allows them to be referenced more often, and
   smarter normalization assures we don't copy in the simple cases
   either.
   
   More tests were added as well.
   This is breaking as lifetime changes can cause disruptions, and
   `values?_as()` was removed as well as it's somewhat duplicate
   to higher-level APIs and it wasn't tested at all.
 - <csr-id-c9933c0b0f51d21dc8244b2acc33d7dc8a33f6ce/> Remove `gix-config` test utilities from `gix-path`.

### Other (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-9cd99337333f5ef4b30e0ec9461fc087699576e6/> `File::raw_multi_value()` to `File::raw_values()`
 - <csr-id-0076dcf9b37f1d633bdad5573b40d34a9fbaba90/> `File::raw_multi_value_mut()` to `File::raw_values_mut()`
 - <csr-id-a8604a237782f8d60a185d4730db57bad81424a6/> `File::multi_value()` to `File::values()`.
   The latter is better in line with `string()/strings()`

## 0.5.0 (2022-06-13)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-266d4379e9132fd7dd21e6c8fccb36e125069d6e/> Make `realpath()` easier to use by introducing `realpath_opt()`.
   That way there is consistency about how many symlinks to follow.

## 0.4.0 (2022-05-21)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-553f87225363903e6acdb3e7eaa8cc66a91110f1/> `File::len()` -> `File::num_values()`
   The same is true for `Section::len()` which now is
   `Section::num_values()`.

## 0.3.0 (2022-05-18)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-36e2fc0aff4e6aaa35335da90108918882d4cd16/> Use `std::env::var_os()` to avoid potential decode errors

### Changed

 - <csr-id-b04a3465ed20d8f3088e5d3faf11e98e5595f219/> `GitConfig::from_paths(<paths>, …)` accepts more inputs
   `<paths>` is more flexible and is easier to use.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7c75eac149c6ecb99c3dd7355d76d8d3e8b59cd0/> `GitConfig::path()` for direct access to paths.
   Very similar to `string()`, but as path, whose query can never fail.
 - <csr-id-031bd2f401199a05d6465c0260ceed3cc849c7ac/> add support for android
   Do not interpolate `~user/` on Android (Termux).
   There is no meaning of it. It is single user system.
 - <csr-id-dc3dc3b41b5de3ec17429769747bf99bb2bdd03d/> support for `try_value()`, `boolean()` and `string()` access`.
   Support for a convenient way of knowing if a value does or doesn't exist
   via `try_value()`, which can only fail if the conversion fails.
   
   Lastly, `string()` is a special case which doesn't fail as there is
   no conversion, and `boolean()` allows to obtain a plain boolean value
   if it was a valid boolean representation.
 - <csr-id-13554f8d21beb241e0fbdeb56b8414957cbee28a/> new hierarchical errors for value lookup
 - <csr-id-4726bb524c1b0935d35770c907d40a0a16dbb8b5/> `GitConfig::integers()`
   Get multiple fully validated integer values, with their suffix
   interpreted and checked for overflow.
 - <csr-id-ae22a4de486676f11469cec84be403903758b48b/> add `GitConfig::integer()`
   A way to quickly obtain a valid integer with suffixes resolved
   and overflow checked.
 - <csr-id-bfc263797226d027e04daaf6426e57183773d7c3/> `GitConfig::strings()` for multi-value strings.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-38dfdcf80f9b7368ccaa10f4b78b2129849848d0/> remove `values::*Error` in favor of `value::parse::Error`.
   This makes it easier to work with errors in practice, we are either
   interested in the value that failed to parse to try something else
   or want a nice user message.
   
   Having one decode error type facilitates that.
 - <csr-id-a98a7a7af69482e9ef63f106184049049939459d/> switch from quickerror to thiserror.
   This allows for generic types for sources of errors and allows to
   workaround a limitation with associated type constraints in the MSRV
   of 1.54.
   
   Using thiserror makes this work and brings the crate more closely
   to the rest of the gitoxide crates (which now prefer thiserror over
   quickerror).
 - <csr-id-a86b2541561674df5dbef4120d3e03483cb80117/> remove all `get_` prefixes from methods
   That way the API is more idiomatic and fits better into the
   existing `gitoxide` crates.
 - <csr-id-f9aaac11f0734afbd791132369eb5601bfc7efe9/> use `lookup::Error` and `lookup::existing::Error`
   Use the newly introduced structured error to replace the 'catch-all'
   `GitConfigError` while getting closer to naming conventions in other
   `gitoxide` crates.
 - <csr-id-c7fcb5e1db225aefc3eeab4f29f3fb85c670894a/> `GitConfig::from_paths(…, <option>)` is now owned.
   The type is `Copy`, so no need to pass it by reference.

## 0.2.1 (2022-04-05)

### Features

- New `values::String` data type which makes it easier to obtain string values to work with as
  binary string.

## 0.2.0 (2022-04-02)

<csr-id-55c00d880535a1f8c37cb7d4405d39ff5a7654a0/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e4d6685064ad2b433f8acd3a74b320bf0169a994/> Add `gix_config::values::Path` for a typesafe git path
   Add a `Path` type to the `gix_config::values` which
   can be interpolated according to gits own path interpolation
   rules.
 - <csr-id-61af06b905926849abce19677ff4b9ac05d625a3/> compatibility with Rust <1.53
 - Respect `include.path` when reading configuration files
 - Support for path interpolation

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-55c00d880535a1f8c37cb7d4405d39ff5a7654a0/> remove `gix_config::values::Value`; use `Bytes` in its place.

## 0.1.11 (2022-01-31)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e822f566dcff3f6c784c206dff2fbc5f82d543be/> subsection iteration.

   section header and section body.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-469406dc0d9fece4a06230ef0d8018846202f0ad/> fix usage example in README.md

   Please feel free to re-add once all other git-* crates have been
   adjusted. It's interesting to see how a crate lint spills into the
   workspace.
   
   Personally I am surprised that the keywords value is supposed
   to repeat the crate name as it seems redundant.
