//! This module handles parsing a `git-config` file. Generally speaking, you
//! want to use a higher abstraction such as [`File`] unless you have some
//! explicit reason to work with events instead.
//!
//! The workflow for interacting with this is to use
//! [`from_bytes()`] to obtain all parse events or tokens of the given input.
//!
//! On a higher level, one can use [`Events`] to parse all events into a set
//! of easily interpretable data type, similar to what [`File`] does.
//!
//! [`File`]: crate::File
