## Support for signal handlers to cleanup tempfiles when a signal is received.
signals = ["dep:signal-hook", "dep:signal-hook-registry"]
## Use a high-performance concurrent hashmap implementation for optimal performance with less contention if there are many tempfiles opening at the same time.
## It also allows to potentially cleanup more tempfiles in a signal handler as the hashmap can be partially locked.
