//! git-style registered tempfiles that are removed upon typical termination signals.
//!
//! To register signal handlers in a typical application that doesn't have its own, call
//! [`gix_tempfile::signal::setup(Default::default())`][signal::setup()] before creating the first tempfile.
//!
//! Signal handlers are powered by [`signal-hook`] to get notified when the application is told to shut down
//! to assure tempfiles are deleted. The deletion is filtered by process id to allow forks to have their own
//! set of tempfiles that won't get deleted when the parent process exits.
//!
//! ### Initial Setup
//!
//! As no handlers for `TERMination` are installed, it is required to call [`signal::setup()`] before creating
//! the first tempfile. This also allows to control how this crate integrates with
//! other handlers under application control.
//!
//! As a general rule of thumb, use `Default::default()` as argument to emulate the default behaviour and
//! abort the process after cleaning temporary files. Read more about options in [`signal::handler::Mode`].
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! ## Tempfiles might remain on disk
//!
//! * Uninterruptible signals are received like `SIGKILL`
//! * The application is performing a write operation on the tempfile when a signal arrives, preventing this tempfile to be removed,
//!   but not others. Any other operation dealing with the tempfile suffers from the same issue.
//!
//! [`signal-hook`]: https://docs.rs/signal-hook
