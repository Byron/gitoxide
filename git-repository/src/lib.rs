//! This crate provides the [`Repository`] abstraction which serves as a hub into all the functionality of git.
//!
//! It's powerful and won't sacrifice performance while still increasing convenience compared to using the sub-crates
//! individually. Sometimes it may hide complexity under the assumption that the performance difference doesn't matter
//! for all but the fewest tools out there, which would be using the underlying crates directly or file an issue.
//!
//! # The prelude and extensions
//!
//! With `use git_repository::prelude::*` you should be ready to go as it pulls in various extension traits to make functionality
//! available on objects that may use it.
//!
//! The method signatures are still complex and may require various arguments for configuration and cache control.
//!
//! Most extensions to existing objects provide an `obj_with_extension.attach(&repo).an_easier_version_of_a_method()` for simpler
//! call signatures.
//!
//! ## ThreadSafe Mode
//!
//! By default, the [`Repository`] isn't `Sync` and thus can't be used in certain contexts which require the `Sync` trait.
//!
//! To help with this, convert it with `.to_sync()` into a [`ThreadSafeRepository`].
//!
//! ## Object-Access Performance
//!
//! Accessing objects quickly is the bread-and-butter of working with git, right after accessing references. Hence it's vital
//! to understand which cache levels exist and how to leverage them.
//!
//! When accessing an object, the first cache that's queried is a  memory-capped LRU object cache, mapping their id to data and kind.
//! On miss, the object is looked up and if a pack is hit, there is a small fixed-size cache for delta-base objects.
//!
//! In scenarios where the same objects are accessed multiple times, an object cache can be useful and is to be configured specifically
//! using the [`object_cache_size(â€¦)`][crate::Repository::object_cache_size()] method.
//!
//! Use the `cache-efficiency-debug` cargo feature to learn how efficient the cache actually is - it's easy to end up with lowered
//! performance if the cache is not hit in 50% of the time.
//!
//! Environment variables can also be used for configuration if the application is calling
//! [`apply_environment()`][crate::Repository::apply_environment()].
//!
//! ### Shortcomings & Limitations
//!
//! - Only a single `crate::object` or derivatives can be held in memory at a time, _per `Easy*`_.
//! - Changes made to the configuration, packs, and alternates aren't picked up automatically, but the current object store
//!   needs a manual refresh.
//!
//! ### Design Sketch
//!
//! Goal is to make the lower-level plumbing available without having to deal with any caches or buffers, and avoid any allocation
//! beyond sizing the buffer to fit the biggest object seen so far.
//!
//! * no implicit object lookups, thus `Oid` needs to get an `Object` first to start out with data via `object()`
//! * Objects with `Ref` suffix can only exist one at a time unless they are transformed into an owned version of it OR
//!   multiple `Easy` handles are present, each providing another 'slot' for an object as long as its retrieved through
//!   the respective `Easy` object.
//! * `ObjectRef` blocks the current buffer, hence many of its operations that use the buffer are consuming
//! * All methods that access a any field from `Easy`'s mutable `State` are fallible, and return `easy::Result<_>` at least, to avoid
//!   panics if the field can't be referenced due to borrow rules of `RefCell`.
//! * Anything attached to `Access` can be detached to lift the object limit or make them `Send`-able. They can be `attached` to another
//!   `Access` if needed.
//! * `git-repository` functions related to `Access` extensions will always return attached versions of return values, like `Oid` instead
//!   of `git_hash::ObjectId`, `ObjectRef` instead of `git_odb::data::Object`, or `Reference` instead of `git_ref::Reference`.
//! * Obtaining mutable is currently a weak spot as these only work with Arc<RwLock> right now and can't work with `Rc<RefCell>` due
//!   to missing GATs, presumably. All `Easy*!Exclusive` types are unable to provide a mutable reference to the underlying repository.
//!   However, other ways to adjust the `Repository` of long-running applications are possible. For instance, there could be a flag that
//!   indicates a new `Repository` should be created (for instance, after it was changed) which causes the next server connection to
//!   create a new one. This instance is the one to use when spawning new `EasyArc` instances.
//! * `Platform` types are used to hold mutable or shared versions of required state for use in dependent objects they create, like iterators.
//!   These come with the benefit of allowing for nicely readable call chains. Sometimes these are called `Platform` for a lack of a more specific
//!   term, some are called more specifically like `Ancestors`.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! #### WorkingTree and WorkTree
//!
//! When reading the documentation of the canonical git-worktree program one gets the impression work tree and working tree are used
//! interchangeably. We use the term _work tree_ only and try to do so consistently as its shorter and assumed to be the same.
//!
//! # Cargo-features
//!
//! ## With the optional "unstable" cargo feature
//!
//! To make using  _sub-crates_ easier these are re-exported into the root of this crate. Note that these may change their major version
//! even if this crate doesn't, hence breaking downstream.
