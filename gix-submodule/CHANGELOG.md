## 0.3.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.
 - <csr-id-25c5bcebd4dbc4ac189d8af044ed0352c6188ce8/> `IsActivePlatform::is_active()` now only considers the URL in passed configuration
   Previously, it would consider the presence of `url` in the `.gitmodules` file as well, which is
   not the way git does it.

## 0.2.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-229bd4899213f749a7cc124aa2b82a1368fba40f/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-229bd4899213f749a7cc124aa2b82a1368fba40f/> don't call crate 'WIP' in manifest anymore.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-af1cab31fd5ead445c988cce058c136c81229ad1/> TBD a way to learn if submodules are active efficiently

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e0d9b09d02f88536b93ab6a31fddf9483881c5c1/> `Modules::is_active()` now counts everything that doesn't match `submodule.active` (if present) as inactive.
 - <csr-id-8172f0e0f19e84fdaedceb87399f3fab4a1eb563/> Assure `gix-submodule` works with Rust 1.65.
   The previous version of this loop, possibly preferable, ran into
   a borrow-check issue that was no more from Rust 1.70 onwards.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3503f4948b42854256c9e8d8336ebe222fee980b/> remove `File::names_and_active_state()` in favor of `File::is_active_platform()`.
   With this platform it's possible to make repeated checks to see if a named submodule is active.
 - <csr-id-4a443e453285095daccdca0fed9e8486ce7892ab/> make API less error prone by enforcing overrides at instantiation time.
   It's made so that overrides can still be applied at a later point.
