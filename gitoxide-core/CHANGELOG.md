## 0.33.1 (2023-10-13)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8011c73ee401bfca03811a249c46a4dd468af1b8/> bump `gix-transport` version to prevent it from being picked up.
   `gix-transport` v0.37.1 could accidentally be picked up by older, incompatible,
   `gix` versions which now fail to build.
   
   Thus v0.37.1 is now yanked and replaced with v0.38.0 along with a new
   release of `gix` to go with it.

## 0.33.0 (2023-10-12)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-46e591914d548bacae2656ffe14a0ea7ca2eb7ae/> `gix status` auto-writes changed indices.
   This prevents expensive operations to re-occour.
 - <csr-id-7ba2fa1c7781230913b0a04ad8684fa7d0143c18/> `gix status -s/--statistics` to obtain additional information on what happened.
   This is useful for understanding performance characteristics in detail.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-0f3a4b0f864645b94f91897507b4d2737ff1ae25/> `gix attrs query` now allows to match directories as signalled by the trailing slash
   Patterns exist that end in a trailing slash and that will naturally match these now, and
   `git` can do the same.
 - <csr-id-ac1d8d4a323fc5fb27b8c458f1babb4acc56ca52/> revert 'byteyarn' addition in favor of `kstring`
   It turns out not to work on certain 32bit targets that `gix` now has to support
   due to Fedora packaging.
 - <csr-id-760d451e3e2abfc13c8d11b91609dd39ccc13bc5/> `gix attrs query` now shows attributes even for paths that aren't already tracked
 - <csr-id-6fb851b88d3da043e747753697097d79e2fce73a/> `gix exclude query` now also displays paths that don't match existing index entries.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-53de126ea571ef9ed911e66c26a4c36cfdc7e0dd/> add support for submodule status
   Previously, submodules where ignored. Now they are treated correctly
   as 'directory' which is compared to what's in the worktree.
   
   We also simplify blob handling.

## 0.32.0 (2023-09-24)

<csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f094f71dc1a50955552509d108556c01517c6ed6/> `gix status` with basic index-worktree comparison
 - <csr-id-3ff5ac0cda9e3e089dc79fdfbff5ff619ee60b1f/> `gix free index from-list` and `gix index from-tree` gain `--skip-hash`.
   This flag can be derived from options, but thus far we have no higher-level
   writing of the index so this has to do to see the difference in performance.
 - <csr-id-dbf778cfe5423c4769123e8b7cf5efc4dce30db7/> `gix remote` and `gix fetch` now fallback to the only available remote if necessary.
   Just like `git`, but we fail loudly if there are more than one remotes.

### Bug Fixes

<csr-id-429682d775ba1046bc30bbd52e9d5a8dc841378f/>

 - <csr-id-7a8f79357ce99c4b86e22be166b54f7376c71469/> cargo-auditable build error
   Use `prodash` instead of `dep:prodash` in gix-features and `tracing`
   instead of `dep:tracing` in gitoxide-core.
   
   The `dep:mydep` syntax removes the implicit `mydep` feature for optional
   dependencies, this triggers a bug in cargo that affects
   `cargo-auditable`. See https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12336
   
   This affects some Linux distributions like NixOS which use
   `cargo-auditable` by default. Related issues:
   
   - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/253911

### Chore (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/> update to the latest `prodash`
   It makes proper usage of `Progress` types easier and allows them to be used
   as `dyn` traits as well.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.31.0 (2023-08-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-1ccbe16117d58b68b25a8e3e66676a61a07dd49c/> `gix submodule` subcommand for simple submodule listing and information retrieval
 - <csr-id-6bc69e37deb3ebd88af8b0e8ffb9661562dcc679/> `gix index entries --recurse-subomdules` to also list submodules.
 - <csr-id-c30ac0c9f89fb4480c8f8c8c0c06fa046dcd4314/> `gix index entries` with styles and pathspecs.
   This adds support for more simple git style, which is faster and thus
   allows for more direct comparisons to `git ls-files`.
 - <csr-id-f194cfc920cc8622215bab5aa6b7b87e4fb9d7b2/> use real pathspecs where it was supported before.
 - <csr-id-cd6cfe4049bacd8d8a691668b5501a673867f149/> add `gix commit verify-signature` to do something akin to `git ... --show-signature`.

## 0.29.0 (2023-06-22)

<csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/> Add `clippy::redundant-closure-for-method-calls` lint

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c494cfd6f80cf273107c626d0f2cbe054db378ee/> `gix --trace` to also print tree-like instrumentation
 - <csr-id-452ed6b79ed0e12ae214af3c8cd49a87dba91c73/> `gix fetch --open-negotiation-graph[=limit]`
   Open the negotiation graph as SVG, after optionally specifying a limit
   as rendering/layouting can be very slow.
   
   It's useful to see how the negotiation algorithm is reasoning about each commit.
 - <csr-id-096838ffa529148b2da3a2382a2d1fdbfe5bee5b/> `gix fetch --negotiation-info` to provide additional information about the negotiation phase.
 - <csr-id-bd32e393fedd01e27a4f6984281bcc3182c63b67/> `bit revision list --svg` to create a visual graph of commits.
   It's mainly a test of how well `layout-rs` performs.
 - <csr-id-2f5e9eb11f2719011f1cc7fdc9d3ee9257ccce32/> `ein t hours` uses git-attributes to see if a file is considered binary

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8817c248dd7c6453ced654d4df304f98ff18ecda/> don't crash when object validation failed during verification.
   When objects can't be serialized, they will trigger an error that manifests as IO error.
   Previously we didn't think of the possibility that writing to an im-memory buffer could fail
   would indeed panic during verification.
   
   This is now fixed.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b82edc8b965344a866039f6c99295db4f8e776e2/> list commit-graph entries by graph traversal, move commit-graph up to `gix` level.
   This is merely a debug tool to learn about generation numbers.
   All commit-graph commands now operate on a repository.

### Commit Statistics

## 0.28.0 (2023-06-07)

<csr-id-dbc6cbb4363c2532f81b0bd6e351c4577bb9e9a3/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-dbc6cbb4363c2532f81b0bd6e351c4577bb9e9a3/> inline format args

### New Features

 - <csr-id-042f2e1388236e3e50b2b148afb28d59803396b5/> `gix index entries` now works on bare repositories.
   It creates the index in-memory if needed based on the current HEAD tree.
   
   This is useful when inspecting attributes and ignore information.
 - <csr-id-596ff7a348afa97171d20347fcdc5671081d80df/> `gix attributes validate-baseline` works in bare repostiories.
 - <csr-id-e1fcc7f69e7b95aeac8cbbde3719a1e6b9dafeba/> `gix attributes validate` to validate attributes and ignore against `git` as baseline.
   Use this command to test the entire index for ignored paths and their attributes and use
   `git check-attr` and `git check-ignore` to validate that `git` agrees. Collect all
   mismatches and print them.
 - <csr-id-450b2325909459c7061f3d02f461c3f0f20f1e86/> `--statistics` for `gix excludes query`
   With it one gets some insights into the work done to fulfil the query.
 - <csr-id-bfdcb147cdc3d0338a4cd2bc915b0e0eeced1e99/> `gix attribute query` as something similar to `git check-attrs`.
 - <csr-id-b8db2072bb6a5625f37debe9e58d08461ece67dd/> `no-repo index from-list` to create an index with empty files from the given list.
   The list could be created with `find . -type f` for example.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-500175f9a932952dfb8b7fe2b1c786a6a8ea9e8c/> make finding bare repos with an index possible with `ein t find`.
 - <csr-id-39b0ba5af2ae463e244b528be93fe6492d122ae5/> also make it possible to find bare repositories with `ein t find`
 - <csr-id-0a1a8a87528d34619520251df90d88950cdba175/> pack-verification doesn't show each thread anymore.
   After all, they don't actually convey interesting information anymore
   as we switched to using shared counters instead.

## 0.26.0 (2023-04-27)

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-02c4659984fa6423bc76cc4980a143edaba8ace0/> fix minor typos

### New Features

 - <csr-id-08e8fc2152794652ba1c986df493c2ac915af9e7/> `gix index entries` also prints attributes.
 - <csr-id-9723e1addf52cc336d59322de039ea0537cdca36/> `gix clone` and `gix fetch` with controls for shallow repositories.
 - <csr-id-5903371ef3a80009eb5d5d336283b61b5966e05f/> Show the date of the commit when tracing a file.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-32cfeac2f4d7bb02f6ce5d01a62906aa64d3e487/> `gix clone` now handles empty repositories.
   Previously it would panic as the case was unexpected, now it prints a message
   informing about the empty repository similar to how git does.
 - <csr-id-82a2cdb480ed1999a06edd9fd39a40278b8af2b9/> chunk-splitting didn't produce chunks correctly and starved threads.
 - <csr-id-ed1d8a06be329cca643da1bc5030ddfe347eadee/> make query display less noisy.
 - <csr-id-f359b38d1cb41795d52b6044607d3998f47bfcae/> leverage the database when obtaining commits in order when querying.
   This prevents us from having to traverse the entire commit graph each time, instead
   we can stop on the first known commit and restore the list of all commits from the
   database in insertion order.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ca8ebdfb9647ff15b0293823bb3bb3c6779c8dd2/> turn `gix free index entries` into `gix index entries`.
 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

## 0.25.0 (2023-02-24)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f8cc62376bd6e940be4c41e84ccbfce111e64e39/> `ein tool query` - a git analytics engine.
   A tool to build and efficiently maintain a database of information contained
   in a git repository, preferably the kind of information that is expensive to obtain,
   in order to facilitate queries that would be prohibitive without an accelerating
   data structure.
 - <csr-id-49520d1f03ee1d011f6e9f2eb07084d327fe95ae/> `gix tree entries` with rev-spec support.
   Previously it wanted a tree-id, now it can derive it itself.

## 0.22.0 (2022-12-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-8c9c243fc574dc17b92a8e2025fbd8efdf2833da/> `gix odb stats` to calculate statistics on the object database.
   This includes the amount of objects along with a listing of where they are
   located.
 - <csr-id-e2b8c5dce7185b5fa194b90f32e642e5c9d1227f/> `gix clone --no-tags` support.
   This is the same as `git clone --no-tags`.
 - <csr-id-9dd5659c386e97900a9c2d8c28ac70cc64ed0a52/> `gix remote ref-map` makes clear which specs are implicit.
   Normally refspecs are coming from the configuration only, but now
   implied specs due to the implicit include-tag feature also matter.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.19.0 (2022-11-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e973dfeaf17ca63385496202e9fdcdd912e20f42/> `gix remote ref-map --show-unmapped-remote-refs`.
   That way it's more obvious to see what was filtered out by ref-specs.
   
   It's also great to validate that server-side filtering via ref-prefix
   will not send refs that are referred to by symbolic refs that are
   not filtered out. That should be fine as it's all about objects,
   it's just something to deal with as we may have to deal with symbolic
   refs that aren't in the set of refs the server sent to us.
 - <csr-id-20259da4ddf9fabfb2d2bd4e2274c0ed42bdb0e5/> `ein t hours` allows to specify the amount of worker threads.
 - <csr-id-23f8402964b57c8928c8a53212afc58e937023ca/> `ein tool hours -l|f` ignores merge commits entirely.
   These need special treatment to count correctly, and are out of scope
   for now.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-3a053284cfefe27873dcc5b4f74d63a560bb5d41/> collect `stderr` and print it afterwards to avoid intersection with line progress.
   Previously it would happen that stderr would be printed directly and mix
   with the line progress (as in `-v`) which also prints to stderr.
   
   Now errors are collected and output at the end once the line renderer
   was already shutdown.
 - <csr-id-05387a6fd78b5b544766b000041a81188317e446/> `ein t organize` won't complain about file:// urls anymore, but skip them.
 - <csr-id-69ef31f42e7f240f764592b640638b6727b5a7e0/> `ein tool hours -l` should now count lines correctly.
 - <csr-id-4feca8e51b0dca0acefa348095363878233bf7d9/> `ein tool hours` now properly calculates per-user lines of code.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-92bbe335688e4c8e96061663e71a599022f7b96f/> remove `gix remote --url` in favor of determining the intention similar to `git fetch`

</details>

## 0.18.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed

 - <csr-id-3c7c9a735f5771ef787cbc86b46cbafc9226f4d6/> `ein tool hours -s` was split into `-f|--file-stats` and `-l|line-stats`.
   That way more information is generated at increasingly high costs.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b8f2f8bac8af5ea5edd774860ee06117a54a723f/> `ein tool hours -s` shows statistics about files added/removed/modified.
 - <csr-id-28c4cae70aab2bd5b479961fcc6ee91ff80f651b/> `ein tool hours --stat` to collect additional statistics per author.
   Note that these are expensive and unconditionally use threads to speed
   up these computations.
 - <csr-id-4d0977dce6ffd8adeeb0af02922cd8e04db8e94e/> `ein tool hours` is (even) faster and uses half the peak memory.
   On the linux kernel, this causes a peak memory usage of 120MB, whereas
   git hovers at 1.4GB.
 - <csr-id-5d0332f51c63c5456a28c8f3f466ad805b2e0626/> `ein tool hours -b` ignores bots.
   For now it only considers bots with names containing `[bot]`.
 - <csr-id-f28783b0d6a8ad37028960f7094c7570768d45cc/> `ein tool hours -p` now shows the percentage of hours worked as well.
   That way it's easier to tell how much time was invested per author.
 - <csr-id-15f1afccb7ed0ebaf217cbbdd58e6ae651a31e42/> `protocol::Context::to_bstring()`, and use it in `example/git-credential-lite`

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-e090f843f5cffc8e8e47a8cac2e6fb98e4c47771/> `gix-diff` is now included by default as part of core functionality

## 0.17.0 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### New Features

 - <csr-id-5d6d5ca305615568dfedbcc10ea86294c0a0472d/> `gix remote refs` to list all remote references of a suitable remote.
   This takes into account either a named remote, or the remote associated
   with the current branch, or the default remote it could deduce or obtain
   from the configuration.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dda995790c260131048484a11e66185b9c841311/> remove `gix free remote ref-list` in favor of `gix remote refs`
   The functionality is the same, but the latter is built on top of a
   repository which is slightly less flexible, but preferable over
   maintaining a non-repo version.

</details>

## 0.16.0 (2022-08-17)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b83f6bdf7f8d8f5cef2a57fa3932b6a0e0988db1/> `--cat-file` flag for `gix rev parse` to cat instead of resolving.
 - <csr-id-e972aad020d3653a53b20fa6e535d5759e239a45/> `gix rev previous-branches` subcommand

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ea35183b53f2ff71bdf2270ac4f7470a85d7756f/> remove `Repository::load_index()` in favor of `repo.worktree().open_index()`.
 - <csr-id-4fd096840ba27da6ce86678a85ede33e3be974ff/> `gix_revision` is now available in `revision::plumbing`.
   That way it won't clash with the higher-level constructs on top of it
   which use the same names.
 - <csr-id-12589cc6f08e4d7aabae30bcdadaa0c2b4850229/> adapt to changes in `gix-url` and use `BString` to represent URLs.
   They can contain paths, which is why `String` can't represent a URL
   losslessly.
   
   For HTTP urls these are ultimately UTF-8 strings though.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c5846e05aa54f0601ac7b8e2e59bcf1ffaa305f1/> `gix rev resolve --explain`
 - <csr-id-e2aff28e818951785d933f4b55b2f1b882729cb6/> `Repository::rev_parse()` returns a `RevSpec`.
   This lays the foundation for actually handling rev-specs faithfully.
   Previous users should use `rev_parse().single()` to obtain a single
   object id which was the only supported usecase previously.

### Commit Statistics

## 0.15.0 (2022-07-22)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-89a41bf2b37db29b9983b4e5492cfd67ed490b23/> remove local-time-support feature toggle.
   We treat local time as default feature without a lot of fuzz, and
   will eventually document that definitive support needs a compile
   time switch in the compiler (`--cfg unsound_local_offset` or something).
   
   One day it will perish. Failure is possible anyway and we will write
   code to deal with it while minimizing the amount of system time
   fetches when asking for the current local time.
 - <csr-id-6f4eea936d64fb9827277c160f989168e7b1dba2/> Associate `file::Metadata` with each `File`.
   This is the first step towards knowing more about the source of each
   value to filter them based on some properties.
   
   This breaks various methods handling the instantiation of configuration
   files as `file::Metadata` typically has to be provided by the caller
   now or be associated with each path to read configuration from.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-eda39ec7d736d49af1ad9e2ad775e4aa12b264b7/> `gix config` with section and sub-section filtering.
 - <csr-id-d99453ebeb970ed493be236def299d1e82b01f83/> `gix config` lists all entries of all configuration files git considers.
   Filters allow to narrow down the output.
 - <csr-id-7f67b23b9462b805591b1fe5a8406f8d7404f372/> Use `gix-config` to write config file on initialization, including `logallrefupdates` and `precomposeunicode`.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-5667a7c1bafcfdff1a278b3ad0e1198cd0cc4653/> `ein tool organize` now ignores worktrees.
   Previously it would report an error due to invalid assumptions.
   The new behaviour acknowledges that worktrees are placed by hand
   and moving them is almost always not what the user would want,
   even ignoring the added complexity in doing so correctly.
 - <csr-id-761695cd10222eccb720812fa41d5295d506fce9/> improve error messages related to object decoding

## 0.14.0 (2022-04-05)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7e99e6aeee9bf200a561d215c586301f5e4a8cbc/> Add `gix repo commit describe`
   It supports typical but basic flags mostly similar to the ones in git.
 - <csr-id-654f4afb794a370b7cd9d9502ff6d0c3378ec417/> `Commit::describe()`
   A way to fluidly configure a `git describe` operation and run it.
   
   Along that, a new `Tag` top-level object was added as well to provide
   convenient access to otherwise lower-level objects. It's not strictly
   required for our implementation here but it's needed for a symmetric
   API.

## 0.13.0 (2022-04-03)

<csr-id-bbc6efeceb26050973e1425e68a52e51b9df4572/>
<csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/>
<csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/>

<csr-id-424c9b3a2b467f5a1e339700257cd4ab72e2e692/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bbc6efeceb26050973e1425e68a52e51b9df4572/> clarify different repository types much better
 - <csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/> Remove light* features, add 'lean-async' in its place; remove termion support
 - <csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/> remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
   With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
   forcing it to be Sync.
 - <csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/> move gix_pack::data::Object to gix_object::Data, massively alter gix_odb::Find trait
   This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
   next generation of object databases.

### Other

 - <csr-id-424c9b3a2b467f5a1e339700257cd4ab72e2e692/> Try to make Handle usable for pack creation
   It's nearly there, but for some reason the boxed dyn traits don't get to
   be Send even though it's specified.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-84ade1d23060f10bf6c8529f8f693d06660b4f4e/> Allow resolution of in-pack ref-deltas
   This finally allows delta tree caches to be used on typical small packs
   returned by GitHub.
 - <csr-id-d33795f9e99d5ad7191c807e42a6fce368932f6b/> keep non "git" repository name extensions
   When converting a remote URL to a destination directory name,
   keep extension strings if they are not equal to "git". For example,
 - <csr-id-6d3f52dc13d7243a6bce6dab89a985114a75d94b/> Avoid the dashmap being cloned for each thread
   Instead, share it by reference, it's sync after all.
   
   This issue was introduced when switching to a `Send + Clone` model,
   instead of `Send + Sync`, to allow thread-local caches in database
   handles of all kinds.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-30b22a870f22a8ad124f15a7d5395a707c1c8fa4/> ein tool estimate-hours with shallow clone support
 - <csr-id-def80df2e165b74f4b053e4030f563902b7d34a4/> `ein tool estimate-hours` now supports mailmaps
 - <csr-id-d2388d8d80f379eccc9ee84ebe07acd67d154630/> `gix repository mailmap entries`
 - <csr-id-384ed665c7423feca1b1ee1f81db10867fa813a8/> `gix mailmap verify` command
 - <csr-id-e3bc1b410409a9e27894a5cac48b06d8c3295e36/> unstable mailmap module
 - <csr-id-3f28e2037fcb07fa022220e52bcf967d6d6ef647/> `ein find` with support for worktree checkouts
 - <csr-id-70109bee679d33a5c5fb3a78a708b479684b03b1/> `ein find --debug` to learn why it is slow
 - <csr-id-00909619ff04e247aabc9ffe3c025f0064c3092d/> --counting-threads flag to configure amount of threads when counting
   The efficiency of multi-threaded counting is low per core, and despite
   some speedups might be desirable, one might not want to commit all cores
   to this amount of waste.
 - <csr-id-aa3795d69926c4506e5bc2d14f447d64bc4e6c2c/> in-manifest and in-lib documentation of feature toggles

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-15d429bb50602363292453606902bdce5042d9a5/> file::Store::(try_)find(…, packed) was removed
   The packed buffer is now handled internally while loading it on demand.
   When compiled with `gix-features/parallel` the `file::Store` remains
   send and sync.
   
   The packed refs buffer is shared across clones and it's recommended
   to clone one `file::Store` instance per thread, each of which can
   use its own namespace.
 - <csr-id-e7526b2a7b51cbac4018e1ab3b623a85987fadc2/> parallel utilities now use `Send + Clone` instead of `Send + Sync`
   This helps to assure that thread-local computations always work with the
   kind of types we provide. The ones that are carrying out actions are
   notably not `Sync` anymore.
   
   We cater to that by defining our bounds accordingly, but for those
   who want to use other utilities that need Sync, using types like
   `Repository` and `thread_local!()` is the only way to make this
   work.
 - <csr-id-e8b091943f0c9a26317da0003f7fcdf5a56ef21a/> Rename gix->ein and gixp->gix
 - <csr-id-bf04644ab75ed1969507f957dc8d4868790d462d/> remove `Option<impl Progress>` in favor of `impl Progress`
 - <csr-id-6829e5e5d6aed1e6c87647144e2dd76a1e4b9f1f/> multi-index integrity check; use `integrity::Outcome` for various integrity checks
 - <csr-id-d851bede97801096d188ff6af06c98a79fe276db/> remove unnecessary `Arc` around `should_interrupt` flag
 - <csr-id-c2679a03358b9c19d63ed1af1cd57324c6381447/> remove Sha1 mentions in `index::verify::Mode::*` variants
   The hash is repository defined and not hard-coded
 - <csr-id-80b120d3278e46429f848df7af3db13413c36649/> introduce `index::File::verify_integrity(…, pack: Option<PackContext>, …)`, replacing tuple
   This allows for more documentation on what input is required there and
   generally makes for an easier to use API.
 - <csr-id-de4fa64843e2c26b86eaaeadd9d6514c96029a9f/> consistently use `object_hash` instead of `hash_kind`

This is a maintenance release signalling breaking changes because some of the crates it depends on have breaking changes.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-71c628d46088ab455b54eb2330d24dcff96c911d/> Use 'cache::Object' trait where it matters
 - <csr-id-8fe461281842b58aa11437445637c6e587bedd63/> split data::output::count::objects into files

### Other

 - <csr-id-54a64a588ff72515451a3d0343306ac4abe1cb35/> try to create persistent Easy iterator, but can't make it Send…
   …which is fair as it contains borrowed RefCells, which really would have
   to be owned to work for this, which would in turn require the Ancestor's
   struct to be kind of self-referential
 - <csr-id-66292fd1076c2c9db4694c5ded09799a0be11a03/> set package cache via RepositoryAccessExt
 - <csr-id-7d2b6b66e09ff39727fccd68d190679b52d90126/> prepare for configurable pack cache

### Chore

 - <csr-id-0456312dddbd9ffd01e29c6705bb794cb1abb414/> fix immediate dereference warning

### New Features

 - <csr-id-60c9fad8002b4e3f6b9607bba6361871752f4d3d/> control pack and object cache size in megabytes in some sub-commands
 - <csr-id-5a8c2da6cb1e2accf7cfdccc16bc3a1d0b2a7dbc/> object cache size is configurable in some sub-commands
