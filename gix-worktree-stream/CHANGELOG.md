## 0.4.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-96a07e08e6090222cf398b46aa8d46b56f81f14d/> Use `Vec::resize()` instead of set_len()
   Otherwise it's possible for uninitialized memory to be used as if it was initialized,
   which can lead to strange behaviour.
   
   As the buffer is re-used, it's not actually zeroing that much memory either.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.
