/// Use `objects` to traverse `tree` and fetch the contained blobs to return as [`Stream`], which makes them queryable
/// on demand with support for streaming each entry.
///
/// `pipeline` is used to convert blobs to their worktree representation, and `attributes` is used to read
/// the `export-ignore` attribute. If set on a directory or blob, it won't be added to the archive.
///
/// ### Types of entries in stream
///
/// We only return blobs (with or without executable), which may be symlinks in which case their content will
/// be target of the symlink.
/// Directories are never returned, but maybe added by the caller via [Stream::add_entry()].
///
/// ### Progress and interruptions
///
/// For per-file progress, integrate progress handling into the calls of [`Stream::next_entry()`] as that
/// correlates blobs.
/// Additional interrupt handling can be wrapped around the `Read` implementation of each [`Entry`][crate::Entry].
/// For progress on bytes-written, integrate progress reporting when consuming the stream.
/// Further it's possible to drop the returned [`Stream`] to halt all operation.
///
/// ### Threaded Operation
///
/// This function spawns a thread that will access the tree data in the background, synchronized through
/// `Stream` so that it will not be faster than the consumer, with at most one file in flight at any time.
///
/// ### Limitations
///
/// * `export-subst` is not support, as it requires the entire formatting engine of `git log`.
