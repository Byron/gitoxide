## 0.6.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.2.0 (2023-09-08)

<csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/>

### Chore (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-ed327f6163f54756e58c20f86a563a97efb256ca/> update to the latest `prodash`
  It makes proper usage of `Progress` types easier and allows them to be used
  as `dyn` traits as well.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-24dd870919ba444aa8099c63a78ea120d47ec28e/> use `prodash::Count` to indicate that nothing more than counting is performed, in place of `prodash::Progress`

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.

## 0.1.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-93feea269eebd114e866e6f29f4a73c0096df9e0/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-93feea269eebd114e866e6f29f4a73c0096df9e0/> split tests off into their own crate to allow feature toggles.
  That way we can test with the `parallel` feature and won't have to
  create bogus feature toggles that are only used for testing, yet visbible
  to users.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fc0529eaa805e696f7297ba8cf0179c5fac7c677/> `checkout()` now creates empty directories for submodules.

### Commit Statistics

 - 2 commits were understood as [conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
