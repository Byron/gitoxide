//! ### Deviation
//!
//! Note that the algorithm implemented here is in many ways different from what `git` does.
//!
//! - it's less sophisticated and doesn't use any ranking of candidates. Instead, it picks the first possible match.
//! - the set used for copy-detection is probably smaller by default.
