## 0.1.2 (2023-03-01)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f84faf7e467d7473d80f87d51fa083a44d0b2f3b/> `sync::ObjectIdMap` for a very limited sharded hashmap implementation.
   It's used only internally, but as capabilities are needed, these will be added.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
