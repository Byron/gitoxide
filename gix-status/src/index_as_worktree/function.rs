/// Calculates the changes that need to be applied to an `index` to match the state of the `worktree` and makes them
/// observable in `collector`, along with information produced by `compare` which gets to see blobs that may have changes, and
/// `submodule` which can take a look at submodules in detail to produce status information (BASE version if its conflicting).
/// `options` are used to configure the operation.
///
/// Note `worktree` must be the root path of the worktree, not a path inside of the worktree.
///
/// Note that `index` may require changes to be up-to-date with the working tree and avoid expensive computations by updating
/// respective entries with stat information from the worktree, and its timestamp is adjusted to the current time for which it
/// will be considered fresh. All changes that would be applied to the index are delegated to the caller, which receives these
/// as [`EntryStatus`].
/// The `pathspec` is used to determine which index entries to check for status in the first place.
///
/// `objects` is used to access the version of an object in the object database for direct comparison.
///
/// **It's important to note that the `index` should have its [timestamp updated](gix_index::State::set_timestamp()) with a timestamp
/// from just before making this call *if* [entries were updated](Outcome::entries_to_update)**
///
/// ### Note
///
/// Technically, this function does more as it also provides additional information, like whether a file has conflicts,
/// and files that were added with `git add` are shown as a special as well. It also provides updates to entry filesystem
/// stats like `git status` would if it had to determine the hash.
/// If that happened, the index should be written back after updating the entries with these updated stats, see [Outcome::skipped].
///
/// Thus, some care has to be taken to do the right thing when letting the index match the worktree by evaluating the changes observed
/// by the `collector`.

    /// # On how racy-git is handled here
    ///
    /// Basically the racy detection is a safety mechanism that ensures we can always just compare the stat
    /// information between index and worktree and if they match we don't need to look at the content.
    /// This usually just works but if a file updates quickly we could run into the following situation:
    ///
    /// * save file version `A` from disk into worktree (git add)
    /// * file is changed so fast that the mtime doesn't change - *we only looks at seconds by default*
    /// * file contents change but file-size stays the same, so `"foo" -> "bar"` has the same size but different content
    ///
    /// Now both `mtime` and `size`, and all other stat information, is the same but the file has actually changed.
    /// This case is called *racily clean*. *The file should show up as changed but due to a data race it doesn't.*
    /// This is the racy git problem.
    ///
    /// To solve this we do the following trick: Whenever we modify the index, which includes `git status`, we save the
    /// current timestamp before the modification starts. This timestamp fundamentally represents a checkpoint of sorts.
    /// We "promise" ourselves that after the modification finishes all entries modified before this timestamp have the
    /// racy git problem resolved.
    ///
    /// So now when we modify the index we must resolve the racy git problem somehow. To do that we only need to look at
    /// unchanged entries. Changed entries are not interesting since they are already showing up as changed anyway so there
    /// isn't really a race-condition to worry about. This also explains why removing the `return` here doesn't have an apparent effect.
    /// This entire branch here is just the optimization of "don't even look at index entries where the stat hasn't changed".
    /// If we don't have this optimization the result shouldn't change, our status implementation will just be super slow :D
    ///
    /// We calculate whether this change is `racy_clean`, so if the last `timestamp` is before or the same as the `mtime` of the entry
    /// which is what `new_stat.is_racy(..)` does in the branch, and only if we are sure that there is no race condition
    /// do we `return` early. Since we don't `return` early we just do a full content comparison below,
    /// which always yields the correct result, there is no race condition there.
    ///
    /// If a file showed up as racily clean and didn't change then we don't need to do anything. After this status check is
    /// complete and the file won't show up as racily clean anymore, since it's mtime is now before the new timestamp.
    /// However, if the file did actually change then we really ran into one of those rare race conditions in that case we,
    /// and git does the same, set the size of the file in the index to 0. This will always make the file show up as changed.
    /// This adds the need to treat all files of size 0 in the index as changed. This is not quite right of course because 0 sized files
    /// could be entirely valid and unchanged. Therefore this only applies if the oid doesn't match the oid of an empty file,
