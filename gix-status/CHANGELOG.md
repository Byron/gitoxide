## 0.6.0 (2024-02-25)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0bef316696fcf11e9f7dc1910819a60e4229f766/> improve `index_as_worktree()` function signature.
   This is accomplished by providing a context which now contains only
   statically known types, among them also a pathspec search. This allows
   the attribute stack to be passed and can thus cheaply be cloned, instead
   of being created internally.

## 0.4.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
   They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
   unecessarily can break downstream CI.
   
   Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
   more recent features are actually used.

## v0.2.0 (2023-10-12)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-de66b4c26a937a4f6462dff5ec58275dae01813a/> `status` now supports filters.
   This is important as it allows to streaming-read from the worktree and
   correctly change, for example, `git-lfs` files back into their manifests,
   and to arrive at the correct hash.
 - <csr-id-0e10b62557fbd5b33a4aebab24e442e23304ac0a/> a way for `status` to stop early.
   That way, 'is_dirty()` scenarios can be done without wasting too much time.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-60c948f55ec432ab40b826a9ce8cb3d8fe15a543/> replace `conflict` marker with detailed decoding of stages.
   We also adjust the returned data structure to allow the input to be immutable,
   which delegates entry updates to the caller.
   
   This also paves the way for rename tracking, which requires free access to entries
   for searching renames among the added and removed items, and/or copies among the added ones.
 - <csr-id-b55a8d58b8bd9e1ba2f9049668c166e75fb0a360/> add entries-relative index to each change.
   That way it's possible to lookup other, surrounding entries in case
   of conflicts or easily find entries that didn't change.
 - <csr-id-0d01eb28ebb2305873726ba1892204fd151f4c4f/> provide statistics at the end of a index status operation
 - <csr-id-53de126ea571ef9ed911e66c26a4c36cfdc7e0dd/> add support for submodule status
   Previously, submodules where ignored. Now they are treated correctly
   as 'directory' which is compared to what's in the worktree.
   
   We also simplify blob handling.

## v0.1.0 (2023-09-24)

<csr-id-93feea269eebd114e866e6f29f4a73c0096df9e0/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-93feea269eebd114e866e6f29f4a73c0096df9e0/> split tests off into their own crate to allow feature toggles.
   That way we can test with the `parallel` feature and won't have to
   create bogus feature toggles that are only used for testing, yet visbible
   to users.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2d011253c64aaeede546a2e4cdd143142689044b/> various improvements

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.
