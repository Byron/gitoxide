/// A function to perform a git-style, unsorted, directory walk.
///
/// * `worktree_root` - the top-most root of the worktree, which must be a prefix to `root`.
///     - If [`Options::precompose_unicode`] is enabled, this path must be precomposed.
///     - The starting point of the traversal (traversal root) is calculated from by doing `worktree_root + pathspec.common_prefix()`.
///     - Note that if the traversal root leading to this directory or it itself is excluded, it will be provided to [`Delegate::emit()`]
///       without further traversal.
///     - If [`Options::precompose_unicode`] is enabled, all involved paths must be precomposed.
///     - Must be contained in `worktree_root`.
/// * `ctx` - everything needed to classify the paths seen during the traversal.
/// * `delegate` - an implementation of [`Delegate`] to control details of the traversal and receive its results.
///
/// Returns `(outcome, traversal_root)`, with the `traversal_root` actually being used for the traversal,
/// useful to transform the paths returned for the user. It's always within the `worktree_root`, or the same,
/// but is hard to guess due to additional logic affecting it.
///
/// ### Performance Notes
///
/// In theory, parallel directory traversal can be significantly faster, and what's possible for our current
/// `gix_features::fs::WalkDir` implementation is to abstract a `filter_entry()` method so it works both for
/// the iterator from the `walkdir` crate as well as from `jwalk`. However, doing so as initial version
/// has the risk of not being significantly harder if not impossible to implement as flow-control is very
/// limited.
///
/// Thus the decision was made to start out with something akin to the Git implementation, get all tests and
/// baseline comparison to pass, and see if an iterator with just `filter_entry` would be capable of dealing with
/// it. Note that `filter_entry` is the only just-in-time traversal control that `walkdir` offers, even though
/// one could consider switching to `jwalk` and just use its single-threaded implementation if a unified interface
/// is necessary to make this work - `jwalk` has a more powerful API for this to work.
///
/// If that was the case, we are talking about 0.5s for single-threaded traversal (without doing any extra work)
/// or 0.25s for optimal multi-threaded performance, all in the WebKit directory with 388k items to traverse.
/// Thus, the speedup could easily be 2x or more and thus worth investigating in due time.
